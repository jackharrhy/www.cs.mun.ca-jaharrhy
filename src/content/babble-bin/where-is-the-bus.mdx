i have a car now! ðŸŽ‰

<BabbleImage src={meAndCar} alt="TODO" containerHeight="15rem" />

i live in a part of the world where having a car is basically required _(boo)_, but it took until i was
23 to finally get my licence sorted, and then till 24 to actually get a car (not a great time to buy a
vehicle)

for the longest while i managed to get by with:

- my own two legs and a good pair of shoes
- bumming rides off of people
- maybe a taxi or two here and there

however, while there is a bus system here...

...its, meh

given that [st. john's is quite old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_St._John%27s_history), its not suprising its streets were designed way before the modern motor vehicle, hence
a lot of the routes the bus service here runs are... interesting

<br />

the company / entity behind bussing here, is [Metrobus](https://www.metrobus.com/home/), and unfortunately, while you can use google maps to view routes and time tables, you _cannot_ see current bus information within the app

i've been to bigger cities with this intergration, or used [transit](https://transitapp.com/), but
alas, that is not available here...

...or is it

<br />

it is, sort of

metrobus has their own app for getting all sorts of information about bus statuses and such on the go

similar to the service they provide

its meh

import metrobusMobileGooglePlay from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-google-play.png"
import metrobusMobileAppMainScreen from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-app-main-screen.png"

<BabbleFlex height="25rem">
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileGooglePlay} alt="TODO" extraSpace="0" />
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileAppMainScreen} alt="TODO" extraSpace="0" />
</BabbleFlex>

here you can see the google play store page for ['m-Mobile v2'](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n1005513&hl=en_CA), alongside its
home screen

behold, _truly the pinnacle of modern app design_ on display here

the application has a few features, most of which are sort of useless since you can just use
google maps to figure out what busses to take / when to take them to get wherever

what it _does_ have, that google maps lacks, is _realtime bus location data_

import metrobusMobileAppTimetrackList from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-app-timetrack-list.png"
import metrobusMobileAppTimetrackBus from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-app-timetrack-bus.png"

<BabbleFlex height="25rem">
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileAppTimetrackList} alt="TODO" extraSpace="0" />
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileAppTimetrackBus} alt="TODO" extraSpace="0" />
</BabbleFlex>

heading into the timetrack page, you can see a list of the busses servicing different routes

the first screen tells you, for each bus:

- is it late?
- how late is it?
- where is it currently?
- what route is it servicing?

you must then click into the list item for the specific bus you care about, to get a page that contains:

- the same information as before
- but with a map showing current bus location (with no visible information of _when_ this location was updated, it could have been 5 seconds ago, or 5 minutes ago)
- and the route that this bus is taking (without the current location of _yourself_ visible on said map)

<br />

this view... gets the job done

but, from a user experience perspective i've always felt like there should
be a better way to display this information in a more concise interface

i'm also a map guy: this data should be on a _map_

but hold up, how does one go about fetching this data?

this is a view in a mobile application, do i have to rip out [`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) and a decompiler to find strings
for the api that backs this page?

_nope!_

<br />

i forget when i saw a link to [metrobusmobile.com](https://metrobusmobile.com/), i think it was on
the metrobus website itself, but quickly, you'll find out that the app, is _just a webview_

import metrobusMobileWebMainScreenPhone from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-web-main-screen-phone.png"

<BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileWebMainScreenPhone} alt="TODO" />

so... this could just been just a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), but of
course its instead an entire app you're asked to download from the app store instead

but, as far as data digging goes, this means one can pop open this same tab within a desktop browser...

import metrobusMobileWebMainScreenLaptop from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-web-main-screen-laptop.png"

<BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileWebMainScreenLaptop} alt="TODO" />

...and dig their dirty fingers directly into the dev tools, to hopefully see what endpoints are being reached out to populate these pages

<br />

now i've done some digging, it seems this is an [ASP.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET) application, with some routes being rendered on the server, but other routes sprinkling in some javascript + apis, usually for pages that they want realtime functionality on

thankfully, this incldues the timetrack page!

import metrobusMobileWebNetworkTab from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-web-network-tab.png"

<BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileWebNetworkTab} alt="TODO" />

all one does to get a blob of json used to populate this screen, is hit this endpoint:

```sh
curl https://www.metrobus.co.ca/api/timetrack/json/
```

any thoughts about any of the above?
