i have a car now! üéâ

<BabbleImage src={meAndCar} alt="myself wearing a green jumper, arms stretched out in front of a green Toyota Matrix, house behind myself." containerHeight="15rem" />

i live somewhere in which having a car is basically required _(boo)_, but it took until i was
23 to finally get my license sorted, and then till 24 to actually get a car

for the longest while i managed to get by with:

- my own two feet and a good pair of shoes
- bumming rides off of friends ‚ù§Ô∏è
- maybe a taxi or two here and there

however, while there is a bus system here...

...its,

meh

given that [st. john's is quite old](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_St._John%27s_history), its not
surprising its streets were designed way before the modern motor vehicle, hence a lot of the bus routes here
runs are... interesting

<br />

but, the routes exist, you can make your way from point a `->` b in the city and (some of) the surrounding areas

and thankfully _the modern ability to use technology to navigate the bus service_ does indeed exist!

unfortunately, while you can use apps like google maps to view routes and time tables for busses, **you _cannot_
see realtime bus information within said map apps**

i've been to bigger cities with this sort of integration, or used [transit](https://transitapp.com/) that had it,
but alas, that is not available here...

...or is it

<br />

it is!, sort of

the company behind bussing here, is [Metrobus](https://www.metrobus.com/home/), and they have their own app for
getting all sorts of information about bus statuses and such on the go

similar to the service they provide however

its meh

import metrobusMobileGooglePlay from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-google-play.png"
import metrobusMobileAppMainScreen from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-app-main-screen.png"

<BabbleFlex height="25rem">
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileGooglePlay} alt="mobile app screenshot, google play store, showing 'm-Mobile v2' with multiple screenshots showing the apps dated look and feel" extraSpace="0" />
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileAppMainScreen} alt="mobile app screenshot, m-Mobile v2, home screen, multiple different squares showing different features up the app, application does not have a modern look and feel" extraSpace="0" />
</BabbleFlex>

here you can see the google play store page for ['m-Mobile v2'](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n1005513&hl=en_CA),
alongside its home screen

behold, _truly the pinnacle of modern app design_

the application has a few features, most of which are useless if you're using a map app already (i think some of
the features here just use google maps under the hood)

what it _does_ have, that map apps lacks, is **_realtime bus location data_**

import metrobusMobileAppTimetrackList from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-app-timetrack-list.png"
import metrobusMobileAppTimetrackBus from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-app-timetrack-bus.png"

<BabbleFlex height="25rem">
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileAppTimetrackList} alt="mobile app screenshot, m-Mobile v2, timetrack page showing list of location of busses, the first busses list item has a yellow background because it is late, it shows that is it Rt 1-1 heading from 'MUN-CNA-MI'. other list items are green because they are either slightly behind or ahead." extraSpace="0" />
    <BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileAppTimetrackBus} alt="mobile app screenshot, m-Mobile v2, timetrack inner page showing location of bus on a map alongside the same metadata as before on that bus" extraSpace="0" />
</BabbleFlex>

heading into the timetrack page, you can see a list of the busses servicing different routes

the first screen tells you, for each bus:

- is it late?
- how late is it?
- where is it currently?
- what route is it servicing?

you must then click into the list item for the specific bus you care about, to get a page that contains:

- the same information as before
- but with a map showing current bus location (with no visible information of _when_ this location was updated, it
could have been 5 seconds ago, or 5 minutes ago)
- and the route that this bus is taking (without the current location of _yourself_ visible on said map)

<br />

this view... gets the job done

but, from a user experience perspective, i've always felt like there is
a better way to display this information in a much more concise interface

i'm also a map guy: this data should _all_ be on a _map_

but hold up, how does one go about fetching this data?

this is a view in a mobile application, do i have to rip out [`adb`](https://developer.android.com/tools/adb) and
a decompiler to find strings for the api that backs this page?

_nope!_

<br />

i forget when i saw a link to [metrobusmobile.com](https://metrobusmobile.com/), i think it was on
the metrobus website itself, but quickly, you'll find out that the app, is _just a webview_

import metrobusMobileWebMainScreenPhone from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-web-main-screen-phone.png"

<BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileWebMainScreenPhone} alt="mobile web browser screenshot of metrobusmobile.com, same home page as in the application seen previously" />

so... this could have just been a [PWA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps), but of
course its instead an entire app you're asked to download from the app store instead

but, as far as data digging goes, this means one can pop open this same tab within a desktop browser...

import metrobusMobileWebMainScreenLaptop from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-web-main-screen-laptop.png"

<BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileWebMainScreenLaptop} alt="desktop web browser screenshot of metrobusmobile.com, same home page as seen twice before, but now in landscape size in a firefox window" />

...and dig their dirty fingers directly into the dev tools, to hopefully see what endpoints are being reached out to
populate these pages

<br />

now i've done some digging, and it seems this is an [ASP.NET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET) application, with
some routes being rendered on the server, but other routes sprinkling in some javascript + apis, usually for pages that
they want realtime functionality on

thankfully, this includes the timetrack page!

import metrobusMobileWebNetworkTab from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/metrobus-mobile-web-network-tab.png"

<BabbleImage src={metrobusMobileWebNetworkTab} alt="firefox screenshot of timetrack page, dev tools open to the network tab, viewing the endpoint that powers the data of the page" />

all one does to get a blob of json used to populate this screen, is hit this endpoint:

```sh
curl https://www.metrobus.co.ca/api/timetrack/json/
```

a simplified version of the json this spits out follows:

```json
[
  {
    "routerun": "Rt 1-1",
    "current_route": "01-1",
    "routenumber": 1,
    "vehicle": "1524",
    "time_stamp": "2:12 PM",
    "deviation": "1 MIN BEHIND",
    "service": "1",
    "current_location": "Cashin Avenue civic  122",
    "bus_lat": "47.55193",
    "bus_lon": "-52.72940",
    "heading": "NNW",
    "speed": 24,
    "position_time": "2:12 PM",
    "position_time_seconds": 51150,
    "departure_time_at_closest_stop": "51060"
    ...
  },
  ...
]
```

_(i removed some fields that were the same data / all the same basically null or boring value)_

so cool, this is the data that's used on both the timetrack list page, and the inner pages!

what's nice is that we actually do get the geospatial information that the inner page uses for every bus, so we only
need to make one request to get all this data

now that i know i can get the data... _what's next?_

<br />

6 years ago, i asked this same question, and built [metrobus-spy](https://github.com/jackharrhy/metrobus-spy)

metrobus-spy was basically just a proxy that would hit the timetrack json endpoint, clean up the data a bit to _just_
contain `latitude`, `longitude`, and the `position_time` values

this api, didn't really do much at all, my friend [riley](https://github.com/nint8835/) threw together a little project
that fed from metrobus-spy and generated some heatmaps, as you can see here:

import rileyHeatmapSrc from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/riley-heatmap.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={rileyHeatmapSrc}
  alt="leaflet map of the areas covered by Metrobus, heat map showing areas where busses are most often, the avalon mall and downtown areas are very red, while places like Mount Pearl are much less covered"
  caption="more red = more busses"
/>

<br />

skip ahead to september of 2022, i start a [new repository](https://github.com/jackharrhy/metrobus-timetrack-history),
inspired by a concept i learned from [Simon Willison's Weblog](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/),
to hit the timetrack api _every 5 minutes_, and store the result into said repository

the setup explained by simon is interesting, it uses a very simple [cron-scheduled github action](https://github.com/jackharrhy/metrobus-timetrack-history/blob/main/.github/workflows/scrape.yml)
that performs whatever fetch you want, and then commits to the repo _if_ the data returned from that endpoint
has changed

this means since this is a public repo, and actions are free on public repos, i don't pay any fees! (the only issue
is if the repo grows in size that it becomes a problem, but i'm just not going to think about that for now...)

i have figured out ways to turn this data into a sqlite database, and then a [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org)
file via [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), but done no future science with the data so far

if this tickles your fancy / you want to use this data for your own project, go right ahead!

<br />

this year, i did end up taking a stab at building my 'envisioned' version of the user interface, very much not
exactly to the point i'd expect it to for others to actually use it, but very much a proof of concept of how the
data can be layed out:

import busBuddySrc from "@images/babble-bin/where-is-the-bus/bus-buddy.png"

<BabbleImage src={busBuddySrc} alt="firefox screenshot, full page map, header of page is green logo of a clip art bus with the text 'BusBuddy'. full screen map shows location of current user, a specific bus is clicked on therefore you can see the route" />

during a weekend, some people i teamed up with during a [local hackathon](https://ecumene.github.io/dontoverthinkit/)
(organized by [mitch](https://mitchellhynes.com/) ‚ù§Ô∏è) built  together a [remix](https://remix.run/) application that
used [mapbox gl js](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/) to plot all the busses

clicking on the busses showed their route, and the map _centers itself on where you are_ not where the bus is,
which even though this application is super bare bones, it honestly feels in many ways an instant improvement
over the timetrack page

more work would have to go into this to make it better, maybe someday i'll get back to it, but if this project
seems like something you'd like to dig into: [prs welcome](https://github.com/jackharrhy/busbuddy)

<br />

all in all, i figured out some time ago how to answer the question _"where are the busses?"_ with code, and
threw a few projects together

<br />

but yeah, i have a car now lol
