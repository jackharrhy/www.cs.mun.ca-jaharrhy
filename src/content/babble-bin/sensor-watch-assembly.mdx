i had a nice fancy _working_ pixel watch, until suddenly a few weeks ago, it decided to suddenly die without any warning, and is out of warrenty

not sure what happened to it, but i still wanted to know the time on my wrist

all the fancy sleep tracking / heartrate / step counting / etc. stuff is _cool_, but the real true utility of _kwowing the time_ was all i really used the pixel watch for,
so until the pixel watch 2 is cheaper, i knew getting a 'regular' watch would be the play

i saw a friend post a picture of their dinky casio watch, and thought, _why not?_, these things are really cheap, and honestly pretty cool looking, so i bought a black
[casio f91-w](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W) from amazon, received it, set the time, and boom, _i was a fan_

this watch is _**iconic**_, with [an interesting bit of spicy history as well](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_F-91W#Usage_in_terrorism)

then, last week, i stumble across the [page on Crowd Supply](https://www.crowdsupply.com/oddly-specific-objects/sensor-watch) from one of my rss feeds i follow,
and remembered hearing about customized internal casio watches some time ago, and due to the price not being outrageous, i quickly picked one up, alongside a new
f91-w in green, since if i mucked up the assembly, i'd not be watch-less

earlier this week, a lovely little box containing a baggie containing the sensor watch arrived!
