TODOS: MAKE IMAGE RESPONSIVE

i want to build something using the quake engine that doesn't feel like it was made using the quake engine

during the process of looking into ways this can be done, i have found many options and routes towards this goal

this is a recap of my _(incomplete)_ journey so far

<br />

first, the initial inspiration that sparked this interest

some time ago, during when it was likely popular on youtube back in the day, i
played [Thirty Flights of Loving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Flights_of_Loving),
a 2012 game by [Brendon Chung / Blendo Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blendo_Games)

/>

i won't dig too much into the games mentioned here, you should
go experience them for yourself instead!

thirty flights is probably better known than its prequel, [Gravity Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Bone),
but of the two i have a softer spot for it

here is some random gravity bone gameplay i recorded:

import gravityBoneWebm from "@images/babble-bin/quake-engine-adventures-1/gravity-bone.webm";

both games utilize the quake ii engine, but:

- are not first person shooters,
- have high resolution (albiet still minimal) textures
- thematically very different from quake look & feel wise
- short (~15 minute) story-filled experiences rather than long games with many levels

you can still sense that the games themselves were built using
brush based level editor tooling if you're used to spotting that
sort of thing, and of course the movement and overall game feel
is very much quake, but these are hardly considerable as quake
source ports / derivatives, they are their own standalone games
simply using [idtech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech) software

<br />

some time has passed since i first knew about these games, probably 10+ years
ago, and i thankfully know a _bit_ more about software and programming these days

so when these games popped back into my head a few weeks ago, i realized
i had much more of a background to dig into the innards of these games and
similar projects, potentially making a similar project of my own

<br />

i have been doing game jams with some friends the past year and so,
and have used a selection of frameworks / tools, such as [Godot](https://godotengine.org/),
[Kaboom.js](https://kaboomjs.com/), [Ambient](https://ambient.run/),
and [LiveView](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html)

i intend to spend more time with godot for future jams, since it would be
nice to pick one tool to master, rather than just jumping around to a bunch
of different tools every time i start a new project

in a future post i intend to go into previous jam entires some more

but _this_ post is about me going down yet another tangent, mostly unrelated
to any incoming jams (although we are planning on doing a quake mapping jam,
so some overlap incoming!)

this endeavour is an endeavour that might only result in the creation of this
post and no more (which would still be seen as a success in my eyes), but
if it does flourish into something you can actually download in the future,
it will be a project made using tooling that i, in every sense of the phrase,
_vibe_ with

tooling that _slaps_, _feels nice_, produces _gnarly_ feelin' games

give me them sweet brushes, triggers, and freeing rigidity

i spent way too much time on tf2/garry's mod/csgo during the days
i played too much games after getting home from school, so when jumping into
`e1m1` and walking around, i immediately feel at home, almost moreso that
things are stripped down to a more primitive feel

getting my hands dirty this many years later with the tools, just seems _fun_

this is not the first time i have looked into this, i did muck around with
source mapping around 2012...

import gmTwoRoom from "@images/babble-bin/quake-engine-adventures-1/gm_tworoom.jpg";

/>

... however as you can see i did not reach a very high skill level

even getting hammer configured to spit out maps garry's mod would understand felt like
a feat. at the time in of itself

there is something just satisfying about most games in the [quake family tree](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Quake_-_family_tree.svg) that don't
stray too far away from the tooling and feel

enough indulging, let's get back on track

so i want to create something similar to gravity bone / thirty flights, and thankfully, _these two games are (partially)
open source_

gravity bone can be found [here](https://github.com/blendogames/gravitybone/), and thirty flights can be found [here](https://github.com/blendogames/thirtyflightsofloving).

both games are heavily modified versions of [KMQuake II](http://www.markshan.com/knightmare/), itself which
is a [source port](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_port) of quake 2's [2001 source code release](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II#Development)
