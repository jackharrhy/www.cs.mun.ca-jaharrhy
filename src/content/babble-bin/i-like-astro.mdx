import BabbleImage from "@components/babble/BabbleImage.astro";

i don't like meta blog posts

as in, posts on a website _about_ the technical choices of the site itself

i've seen some blogs that end up _just_ containing meta posts, with no actual follow up of real
content, before the author moves onto yet another choice of web framework / tool to power their site,
and therefore nukes the previous posts since they no longer talk about `$CURRENT_HYPE_FRAMEWORK`

_but,_

[astro](https://astro.build/), is **cool**

i've used it for a _lot_ of sites, and would like to chronicle where i've used it before, since
often when the topic of astro comes up, all i can really do is mention:

> i've used astro to build site-a.com / site-b.dev / tilde-site.sh/~site / ...

so if the reason you've ended up on this page, is that i've started to talk about astro / brought it
up somewhere on the internet and linked this article, hello! 👋

<br />

its funny writing this post, since this `.mdx` file i have open in my editor will potentially outlive the
current technical choice i'm making to use astro for this site, but i've used it too extensively at
this point across _many_ websites _not_ to talk about it

i'm sure future me will denote something at the top of this post pointing out if i've moved on from
astro to something different in the future

but i'm writing in the _now_, so no more about future me

<br />

before i get into astro, i'd like to quickly discuss what i've used before

<br />

my main website, [jackharrhy.com](https://jackharrhy.com), was originally created as a plain html/css
site back in 2014, hosted on a cpanel instance on [lotosus](https://www.lotosus.com/)

import jackharrhyCom2014 from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/jackharrhy-com-2014.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={jackharrhyCom2014}
  alt="blue background website, minimalist silhouette of just 14 year old jack's hair and glasses, three darker blue navigation buttons, 'about', 'projects', and 'contact', small text v1 below all the buttons"
  caption="'v1' of my site, probably the only version with, well, a version!"
  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510200429/http://pages.jackharrhy.com/home.html"
/>

i had no idea for the longest time why i chose lotosus over basically any other provider, but after doing research
online for this article, i ran across [this reddit post from 2015](https://old.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wq56g/today_my_comapny_switched_webhosting_to/) mentioning
they accepted dogecoin as payment, at a time i was quite into dogecoin, so that was _probably_ why i picked them

digging deeper into the wayback machine / my personal sites repository to document the major revisions over the years is something
i'd like to do in detail someday, but the abridged summary, is that after moving on from original version, i think i had
iterations that were:

- a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) site (not making very much use of webpack features)
- using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) at one point?
- probably back to a plain html/css/js site at times
- one had a backend serving blog posts from a database, which as most blogs that aren't static and hand
  rolled, are lost to time in `.git`
- a version written in [crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) that did some trickery with docker to show the containers running
  on my VPS the site was hosted on, while that one had a backend which i usually avoid for a personal site, it was _cool_

the current version of jackharrhy.com, was however, not my first astro endeavour...

<br />

## [muncompsci.ca](https://muncompsci.ca)

the website for my computer science student society at my university, [MUN](https://mun.cs), was by the time
that i was involved with the executive around 2017, a [lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) website

import muncompsciCaLektor from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/muncompsci-ca-lektor.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={muncompsciCaLektor}
  alt="large sidebar on the left with a logo for the memorial university computer science society, alongside some links to subpages such as the society itself and a link to the discord guild along other entires.  viewing the homepage of the website explaining the basics of the society, alongside links to where to find the society online and places to join to get involved with the society"
  caption="the nice and clean previous muncompsci.ca site, it thankfully had good structural bones"
  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210803020452/http://muncompsci.ca/"
/>

lektor was nice, it was very pythonic, it got the job done as far as letting you author sites
with minimal markdown files / some jinja templating sprinkled in, but once we tried to push things with it a bit
further, like adding [a blog system](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/pull/46), we were writing a lot of custom code to
achieve what we wanted

<br />

i knew around 2020 i wanted to do a rewrite, and the _hot_ choice at the time was to use [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

i don't like disliking frameworks, but i tried to and _failed_ to 'jive' with gatsby, it felt like i
was required to bend myself backwards to get even the most basic of structure setup, with oodles of
plugins to setup after installing gatsby to get basic things like mdx working, or needing to write
chunks of graphql here and there before i could start seeing text on the screen that wasn't just slapped
directly into components

i see why gatsby was popular, especially if you were working a lot with external cms systems that could
expose themselves as graphql, but if you were like myself and just intending to serve static files in the
same repo alongside the layout files, quite a lot of boilerplate was required regardless

i don't know if it has gotten better, i hope it has, but i abandoned my attempt at making muncompsci.ca
a gatsby site once i realized how much work was required to even get a basic site created, and i didn't
feel it was the most maintainable thing for future contributors to the website

<br />

time passed after the gatsby attempt, and since i'm usually on the prowl on the [orange site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27440553) /
watching [fireship videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsTXcSeAZq8) / overall consuming a lot of webdev-leaning technical content, astro popped up on
my radar

import astro2021 from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/astro-2021.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={astro2021}
  alt="astro's website back in 2021"
  caption="how astro's website looked back in 2021, much more busy today!"
  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210426210422/https://astro.build/"
/>

the simplicity of astro from the early examples i saw made it intriguing to me, while still seeing
that it gave you expanded functionality when you wanted it without the same level of complexity or
manual effort required than lektor and gatsby

i didn't jump into using it right away, but by the time [astro 0.19.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-019/) hit,
i gave it a go for another shot at rewriting the muncompsci.ca site

it did not take me very long!, the slowest part was just figuring out a rejig of the
content / look & feel of the site, i.e. _the bit i wanted to focus on in the first place_

the first version looked like this:

import muncompsciCaAstro from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/muncompsci-ca-astro.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={muncompsciCaAstro}
  alt="modern muncompsci.ca astro website, dark mode in comparison to the previous light mode version.  similar left sidebar with logo, main page has large join our discord action button, alongside links to upcoming events as large border radius'd clickable cards"
  caption="mostly the same structural bones, a bit more custom UI however, and a dark mode"
  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210926140621/http://muncompsci.ca/"
/>

you can find the [initial commit of the astro version here](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/commit/beff440f0ed54944a4bf910aab1740352e200654)

its cool looking at files like `index.astro` in [the old version](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/beff440f0ed54944a4bf910aab1740352e200654/src/pages/index.astro),
alongside [the new version](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/index.astro); the overall structure remains similar to this day

i remember how happy i was for a framework to get out of the way, and simply _let me get things done_, especially in comparison
to my previous attempt to use gatsby for the same website

to give an example of a page that's very simple, lets look at [this event page](https://web.archive.org/web/20240116182624/http://muncompsci.ca/events/january-2022-xonotic/):

import muncsXonotic from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/muncs-xonotic.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={muncsXonotic}
  alt="similar layout to previous image, very basic event page with the text 'Xonotic Night' at the top of the page, alongside a square aspect ratio poster advertising a xonotic event happening on campus on july 13th 2022, alongside a link to the discord"
  caption="xonotic night event page, these events were really fun"
  credits="Current site, via Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20240116182624/http://muncompsci.ca/events/january-2022-xonotic/"
/>

the markdown that powers this page is as follows:

```mdx
---
layout: ../../layouts/Markdown.astro
title: January 2022 Xonotic Night
---

# Xonotic Night

<br />

![](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~csclub/assets/posters/2022/xonotic_jan_2022.jpg)
```

the header on the page and the image are simply as you'd expect from a markdown file, markdown, cool!

but, obviously there is some magic happening with `layouts/Markdown.astro` in the frontmatter, but thankfully even that magic is... simple:

```astro
---
import Main from "./Main.astro";
const { content } = Astro.props;
---

<Main title={content.title}>
	<div class="markdown">
		<slot />
	</div>
</Main>
```

in `Markdown.astro`, we pluck out the content from the markdown file so we can give the page a title, and use the [`<slot />`](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/#slots) element to denote where the rendered markdown content should end up

but then the magic must live in `Main.astro`! where's all the busy logic?

```astro
---
import LeftSidebar from "../components/LeftSidebar.astro";
import "../styles/base.css";
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<html lang="en" class="h-full">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<title>MUNCSS | {title}</title>
		<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
	</head>
	<body class="h-full dark:bg-background-dark">
		<main
			class="h-full w-11/12 md:w-3/4 xl:w-7/12 2xl:w-1/2 m-auto flex flex-col md:flex-row"
		>
			<LeftSidebar />
			<div
				class="py-5 px-4 w-full md:w-9/12 h-full overflow-y-visible md:overflow-y-auto"
			>
				<slot />
			</div>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

here in `Main.astro` is just the shared layout all the pages use, its mostly just a blob of html styled by tailwind, with a little bit of what looks like jsx/react with a `LeftSidebar.astro` component imported here so all the content isn't stuffed into one file

this is, _nice_

astro gives you simple composition tools with simple components that can take in optional properties, but with something that feels like writing plain vanilla html much more than it does a using bespoke javascript framework / custom dsl / etc.

however when you do want to get your hands dirty with a super custom _busy_ page, astro will still give you the tools required to do so, and for the most part, get out of the way

unlike with lektor which required opting out of the default functionality and writing your own integration sort of for non trivial features, with astro, if i want complete custom control over a single page, i [just write in a `.astro` file for that page with what i need for it](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/events/fall-2022-election/candidates.astro)

be that the [list of executives](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/society/executives.astro), or the [listing page for all the events](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/events.astro)

astro makes adding these sorts of pages easy, often times with minimal levels of bespoke code required, or encouraging you to break logic into into reusable components

and thankfully, as expected, contributions from others who have never used astro came in after i merged the refactor, and everyone has seemed to have a good time!

so, back to my personal website

i enjoyed using astro for muncompsci.ca, so i knew eventually i'd convert my personal site to use it as well

in april of 2022, i [did just that](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.com/commit/7450b1820872cef41037cf3876c0021dea590b39)

import jackharrhyCom from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/jackharrhy-com.png"

  alt="calm sand-colored white background main landing page for my website, spinning cup of low poly tea at the top of the page.  left sidebar with my name and navigation links, alongside links to social media and github and such.  main content on the page starts with 'hi i'm jack' and gets into what companies and local groups i'm associated with, ending with my contact information"

/>

while this is my most 'prominent' astro website, it's the one i have the _least_ to talk about, since it has the fewest
amount of features and pages than any other astro site of mine

the [homepage is nice and basic](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.com/blob/955a74439912ef253777ccb2b05112f41a80b93e/src/pages/index.astro), the only interesting thing on it is probably [the mug component](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.com/blob/955a74439912ef253777ccb2b05112f41a80b93e/src/components/Mug.astro), which uses the [picocad-web-viewer](https://github.com/lucatronica/picocad-web-viewer/tree/main) initialized using a handy [astro `<script>`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) tag within a `.astro` component to spin a 3d model of a tea cup i created using [picoCAD](https://johanpeitz.itch.io/picocad)

import jackharrhyComProjects from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/jackharrhy-com-projects.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={jackharrhyComProjects}
  alt="same layout as previous image, a grid of projects, each one with a small screenshot of the same aspect ratio, and a small three line description of the project.  broken up into sections based on what i'm working on currently, what's on the 'back burner', or other previously worked on projects"

  credits="Current site, via Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20240116182624/http://jackharrhy.com/projects/"
/>

it has a [projects page](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.com/blob/68db914e1cd96b721f0d530fab8b2308660116b2/src/pages/projects.astro), that has 'projects' defined like so:

```astro
<Project
  title="~jaharrhy"
  link="https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/"
  description="my labnet garden, giving old web vibes"
/>
```

in which `Projects.astro` is simply:

```astro
---
const { title, link, description } = Astro.props;
---

<a href={link} target="_blank">
	<div class="w-[10.5em]">
		<img
			src={`/images/projects/${title}.webp`.toLowerCase()}
			class="w-[10.5em] h-[7.75em] object-cover border"
		/>
		<h3 class="mt-2 text-[0.85em]">
			<span class="font-semibold">{title}</span>
			{description}
		</h3>
	</div>
</a>
```

_nice_

<br />

all i can really say here, is that it's _nice_

not making use of many special features because its a pretty simple personal site as the moment

<br />

## [www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/)

around july of 2022, i also switched over my [mun page](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/tree/c2a82aa90b11725d4169dc02aed780192bd94747) to astro, the site that i currently have this blog post hosted on!

previous to using astro, my intent was to keep things as similar as possible to the 'old web' / as a callback to geocities era

the most important thing was making sure the look and feel felt correct, but i also thought it'd be interesting
to avoid using any sort of build tool, and just 'hand roll' the html/css/js ([by `ssh`-ing into `garfield` and cracking open `vim`](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/how-to-make-mun-page/))

this was fine when the site was new, but i kept layering on features and buttons and subpages, therefore
the html after a while become similar to [Fordite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fordite), i.e. busy, large, no
reuse

the biggest issue was that it felt hard to add new features to that version of the site

picking astro did feel like i was going back on one of my goals of not using a build system, but after i was done i
was able to focus a lot more on the content and feel than worrying about code structure, so the version that stands today is
a thankfully improved version of what stood before, let's dig into it a bit:

import csMunJaharrhy from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/cs-mun-jaharrhy.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={csMunJaharrhy}
  alt="pink background website. header is a combination of a dithered image of myself with long hair, lights in the background, heavy purple tint, image has dotted purple border. alongside image is my name, the fact that i'm a student, my email, where i'm from (St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada), and a rough lon/lat for my location.  the body of the page is split into two unevenly sized vertical columns.  first vertical column contains a status page section stating that 19 hours ago i wrote the text 'trying 2 write', next is a button to the quotes page, white text on pink button background, next is a collection of posts from my tealog rss feed, with a list of entries from that, last is a cut-off view of 'Esteemed Colleagues', other people's mun sites.  right column starts off with a tamagotchi on the page with a feed meter, below that is the text that reads 'this is egg, please feed him', after that is a linkbox linking to other similar sites i have on the internet, beneath that finally is the cursive text for a header of a section named 'gamejams', with 3 jams visible, 'conjam april 2024', 'squidjam jan 2024', and 'ceojam oct 2023'"
  caption="busy homepage, but busy in the intended way!"
  credits="Current site, via Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20240622190034/https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/"
/>

this is the homepage, where most of my effort has been spent on since i created the site in 2019

each div on this page has its own thing going on, and that is _very_ much intentional

the colors, while not as striking as the average geocities beautiful eyesore, are still a lot more complex than the simple
'safe' color palette most websites tend to lean towards these days

<br />

most of the pages on this site are a bit too busy to chronicle with just one code block, but if you check out the source for
the root / index page [here](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/blob/4c5fb692d8159ae6946abfb3f2e900ef81bec9bb/src/pages/index.astro),
you'll see that i'm importing a considerable amount of components

even though there is a lot of css and code required for this page, it would be much more complex if i was still limiting
myself to just plain html, astro lets me compose components together with ease

(and no, i know you could probably go crazy with html `<template>` element and some custom javascript, but that did not feel like
something i wanted to spend any time considering)

import csMunJaharrhyBabble from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/cs-mun-jaharrhy-babble.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={csMunJaharrhyBabble}
  alt="white background minimal site, showing the listings page for the babble bin at the time of the post, only 4 posts are visible starting from the 'what is this?' post"

  credits="Current site, via Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20240622192118/https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/babble-bin/"
/>

can't not mention the babble bin, on _the babble bin_

i am using two fantastic pieces of astro here, [content collections](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/content-collections/),
and [`@astrojs/rss`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/)

the content collections can read from a [directory of files, such as `.mdx` files](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/tree/02b4a8bd18d5b0c585cf37648bb424a465f9dc18/src/content/babble-bin),
and [given a simple schema](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/blob/02b4a8bd18d5b0c585cf37648bb424a465f9dc18/src/content/config.ts),
give you [type-safe utility functions for iterating through said collections](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/blob/02b4a8bd18d5b0c585cf37648bb424a465f9dc18/src/pages/babble-bin/%5B...slug%5D.astro),
alongside methods to render that content easily into into a `.astro` page

all of the above sounds like a lot, especially if you are coming from the world of gatsby, but astro makes this sort of
thing quite a lot easier

<br />

[`@astrojs/rss`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/rss/), is used to power the babble bin's [rss feed](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/babble-bin/rss.xml), this i can include in this blog post due to its tiny size!

```tsx
import rss from "@astrojs/rss";
import { getCollection } from "astro:content";

export async function GET(context) {
  const babbles = (await getCollection("babble-bin")).filter(
    (entry) => entry.data.pubDate !== null
  );
  return rss({
    title: "babble bin",
    description: "a bin full of babbles",
    site: context.site,
    items: babbles.map((post) => ({
      title: post.data.title,
      pubDate: post.data.pubDate,
      description: "",
      link: `./babble-bin/${post.slug}/`,
    })),
    customData: `<language>en-us</language>`,
  });
}
```

nice and simple, this also makes use of the collections feature, basically just reshaping the data to a structure the `rss`
function accepts, which will spit out a compliant rss feed

<br />

the structure of my mun site is great, as in it almost completely lacks any sort of structure in some ways,
and is instead welcoming to any content that wishes to call it home

one such piece of recurring content is game jam entries, above being [the entry for growthjam](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/gamedev/jams/growthjam-feb2023/)

you'll find pages like these strewn across my mun site, [with nice and tidy `.astro` files implementing them](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/blob/36920e6bf4b7063fddb8788b991512ae6cc1132b/src/pages/gamedev/jams/growthjam-feb2023/index.astro) with whatever look and feel felt right for each individual page

and lastly, one of my only uses of an interesting feature of astro: a page using [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/)

astro lets you mix and match different frameworks of your choosing, even on the same page, with ['islands'](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/)

for this page, i wanted to use [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/), and they actually had an example of using maplibre with solid, and since solid is a library
without a virtual dom that still feels like react from a syntax perspective, it made sense to reach for it for interfacing with a framework agnostic javascript library

there's no actual content here though, i got the basemap working as a full page background, and _shipped it_ ⛴️

## [jackharrhy.neocities.org](https://jackharrhy.neocities.org/)

then, after all the others, in december of 2022, i moved [my neocities page over to astro](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.neocities.org/tree/09d6514ebd63cf2a57a23ed2b41f80c39a210011)

(it was hardly a website beforehand however, i think sometime in 2020 i threw a simple 'hello world' onto the page and
forgot about it, so maybe i can consider this my only current astro greenfield website!)

import jackharrhyNeocitiesOrg from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/jackharrhy-neocities-org.png"

<BabbleImage

  alt="calm yet bright pink background website, header reads in regular sized text 'jacks page', followed by 'a place on the internet, just like any other place'.  beneath this is the only bit of content on the page, a dithered image of clip-art leaves, with the text 'tea log' overladed on top in white text with a black border"

/>

the tealog is the meat of my neocities website, maybe someday there will be more, but for now, tea

import jackharrhyNeocitiesOrgTealog from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/jackharrhy-neocities-org-tealog.png"

<BabbleImage

  alt="calm yet bright pink background website, regular sized header text reading '14-02-2024', large square image beneath that header showing myself holding a glass mug of cream of earl grey tea, behind myself is a snow covered wintery driveway.  text beneath image 'big snow day leads to big cup of cream of earl grey. same tea as last log, but this time, not even a dash of milk in it, it stands very strongly on its own!  this is in an ikea mug i picked up, in ikea during my last trip to the UK in June of this last summer (‘23), it is a very nice mug'"
  caption="it was quite a good cup of tea"

/>

again, we have heavy usage of content collections from astro to take a directory of `.mdx` files, this time with
a _rating system_ in the tags

the thing i'm the most happy about on this site isn't actually astro, but instead the [fish script i wrote](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.neocities.org/blob/main/scripts/dither-tealog.fish) to take the high definition versions of
the tea images, and turn them into bordered and dithered thumbnails for use on its own listing page, and the rss feed

similar to my mun page i wanted to make this no build plain html/css site, but yet again since i wanted to write textual content,
i was a much bigger fan of having the usual write markdown and use a build tool approach for this site as well

## honorable mentions

  if you're reading this gavin, fix it and poke me so i can update my post 😊

some of these look like they were greenfield astro websites from scratch, while others are using templates, all of them of course are great!

## i like astro

i enjoy astro, i hope to be using it into the future, and that it continues to receive great updates over the years

maybe one day i will consider using it for more than just static websites and use one of its
[newer features](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/server-side-rendering/) that permits for server side rendering, therefore turning astro into something
more akin to a next or remix

but it's a static website powerhouse i will continue to shill
