i don't like meta blog posts

as in, posts _about_ the technical choices of the surrounding site itself

i've seen some blogs that end up _just_ containing meta blog posts, with no actual follow up of real
content, before the author moves onto yet another choice of framework, and therefore nukes the
previous posts since they no longer talk about `$CURRENT_HYPE_FRAMEWORK`

_but,_

[astro](https://astro.build/), is **cool**

i've used it for a _lot_, and would like to chronicle where i've used it before, since often when the
topic of astro comes up, all i can really do i post

> i've used astro to build site-a.com / site-b.dev / cool-tilde-site.sh/~site

so if the reason you've ended up on this page, is that i've started to talk about astro / brought it
up somewhere on the internet and linked this article, hello! ðŸ‘‹

<br />

its funny writing this post, since this `.mdx` file i have open in vim will potentially outlive the
current technical choice i'm making to use astro for this site, but i've used it too extensively at
this point across _many_ websites _not_ to talk about it

i'm sure future me will denote something at the top of this post pointing out if i've moved on from
astro to something different

but i'm writing in the _now_, so no more about future me, sorry!

<br />

before i get into astro, i'd like to quickly discuss what i've used before

my main website, [jackharrhy.com](https://jackharrhy.com), was originally created as a plain html/css
site back in 2014, hosted on a cpanel instance by [lotosus](https://www.lotosus.com/)

import jackharrhyCom2014 from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/jackharrhy-com-2014.png"

<BabbleImage

  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20140510200429/http://pages.jackharrhy.com/home.html"
/>

i had no idea for the longest time why i chose lotosus over basically any other provider, but after doing research
online for this article, i ran across [this reddit post from 2015](https://old.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1wq56g/today_my_comapny_switched_webhosting_to/) mentoining
they accepted dogecoin as payment, at a time i was quite into dogecoin, so that was _probably_ why i picked them

digging deeper into the wayback machine / my personal sites repository to find each major revision is something
i'd like to get into much more detail someday, but the abridged summary, is that after moving on from original version, i think i had
versions that were

- a [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) build with little fluff
- using [parcel](https://parceljs.org/) at one point?
- probably back to a plain html/css/js site at some point
- one had a backend written in express for dynamic blog posts, which as most blogs that aren't static and hand
  rolled do, is lost to time in `.git`
- a version written in [crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/) that did some trickery with docker to show the containers running
  on my VPS the site was hosted on, while that one was a backend which i usually avoid for a personal site, it was _cool_
- and then, an astro site!

the astro version of jackharrhy.com, was however, not my first astro endeavour...

## [muncompsci.ca](https://muncompsci.ca)

the website for my computer science student society at my university, [MUN](https://mun.cs), was by the time
that i was involved with it around 2017, a [lektor](https://www.getlektor.com/) website

import muncompsciCaLektor from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/muncompsci-ca-lektor.png"

<BabbleImage

  alt="TODO"

  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210803020452/http://muncompsci.ca/"
/>

lektor was nice, it was very pythonic, it got the job done as far as just being able to author sites
with minimal .md / some .html templating sprinkled in, but once we tried to push things with it a bit
further, like adding [a blog system](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/pull/46) with templating, we were writing a lot of custom code to
achieve what we wanted

<br />

i knew around 2020 i wanted to do a rewrite, and the _hot_ choice at the time was to use [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)

i don't like disliking frameworks, but i tried to and _failed_ to 'jive' with gatsby, it felt like i
was required to bend myself backwards to get even the most basic of structure setup, with oodles of
plugins to setup after installing gatsby to get basic things like mdx working, or needing to write
chunks of graphql here and there before i could start seeing text on the screen that wasn't just slapped
directly into components

i see why gatsby was popular, especially if you were working a lot with external cms systems that could
expose themselves as graphql, but if you were like myself and just intending to serve static files in the
same repo alongside the layout files and such, quite a lot of glue was required regardless

i don't know if it has gotten better, i hope it has, but i abandoned my attempt at making muncompsci.ca
a gatsby site once i realized how much work was required to even get a basic site running, and i didn't
feel it was the most maintainable thing for future contributors to the website

<br />

time passed after the gatsby attempt, and since i am usually on the prowl on the [orange site](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27440553) /
watching [fireship videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dsTXcSeAZq8) / overall consuming a lot of webdev blog content, astro popped up on
my radar

import astro2021 from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/astro-2021.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={astro2021}
  alt="astro's website back in 2021"
  caption="how astro's website looked back in 2021, much more busy today!"
  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210426210422/https://astro.build/"
/>

i liked the idea it was bringing to the table, and didn't jump into it right away, but by the time
[astro 0.19.0](https://astro.build/blog/astro-019/) hit, i gave it a go for the muncompsci.ca site

i don't think it took me very long, the longest bit might have been just figuring out a rejig of the
content / look & feel of the site, i.e. _the bit i wanted to focus on the entire time_

the first version looked like this:

import muncompsciCaAstro from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/muncompsci-ca-astro.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={muncompsciCaAstro}
  alt="TODO"
  caption="TODO"
  credits="Wayback Machine"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20210926140621/http://muncompsci.ca/"
/>

you can find the [initial commit of the astro version here](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/commit/beff440f0ed54944a4bf910aab1740352e200654)

its cool looking at files like `index.astro` in [the old version](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/beff440f0ed54944a4bf910aab1740352e200654/src/pages/index.astro),
alongside [the new version](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/index.astro); the overall structure remains similar to this day

i remember how happy i was for a framework to get out of the way and simply _let me get things done_, especially in comparison
to my previous attempt to use gatsby for the same website

to give an example of a page that's very simple, lets look at [this event page](https://web.archive.org/web/20240116182624/http://muncompsci.ca/events/january-2022-xonotic/):

import muncsXonotic from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/muncs-xonotic.png"

<BabbleImage
  src={muncsXonotic}
  alt="TODO"
  caption="TODO"
  credits="Current site"
  creditsUrl="https://web.archive.org/web/20240116182624/http://muncompsci.ca/events/january-2022-xonotic/"
/>

the markdown that powers this page is as follows:

```mdx
---
layout: ../../layouts/Markdown.astro
title: January 2022 Xonotic Night
---

# Xonotic Night

<br />

![](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~csclub/assets/posters/2022/xonotic_jan_2022.jpg)
```

obviously there is some magic happening with `layouts/Markdown.astro`, but thankfully even that magic is... simple:

```astro
---
import Main from "./Main.astro";
const { content } = Astro.props;
---

<Main title={content.title}>
	<div class="markdown">
		<slot />
	</div>
</Main>
```

but the magic must live in `Main.astro` then! where's all the busy logic?

```astro
---
import LeftSidebar from "../components/LeftSidebar.astro";
import "../styles/base.css";
const { title } = Astro.props;
---

<html lang="en" class="h-full">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8" />
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width" />
		<title>MUNCSS | {title}</title>
		<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
	</head>
	<body class="h-full dark:bg-background-dark">
		<main
			class="h-full w-11/12 md:w-3/4 xl:w-7/12 2xl:w-1/2 m-auto flex flex-col md:flex-row"
		>
			<LeftSidebar />
			<div
				class="py-5 px-4 w-full md:w-9/12 h-full overflow-y-visible md:overflow-y-auto"
			>
				<slot />
			</div>
		</main>
	</body>
</html>
```

here is just the shared layout all the pages use, its mostly just a blob of html, with a little bit of what looks like JSX/React with a `LeftSidebar.astro` component

this is, _nice_

this basically, at least to me, is simple composition with components and props, but with something that feels like plain vanilla html more than it does a bespoke javascript framework

however when i do want to get my hands dirty with a super custom busy page, astro still gives me the tools required to do so within very easy reach

unlike with lektor which very much required opting out of the default functionality and writing your own integration sort of, with astro, if i want complete custom control over a single page, i [just write in a `.astro` file for that page with what i need for it](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/events/fall-2022-election/candidates.astro)

be that the [list of executives](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/society/executives.astro), or the [listing page for all the events](https://github.com/MUNComputerScienceSociety/MUNCS-Website/blob/main/src/pages/events.astro)

astro makes adding these sorts of pages trivial with often times minimal levels of code

and thankfully, as expected, contributions from others who have never used astro came in, and everyone has seemed to have a good time!

so, back to my personal website

i enjoyed using astro for muncompsci.ca, so i knew eventually i'd convert my personal site to use it as well

in april of 2022, i [did just that](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.com/commit/7450b1820872cef41037cf3876c0021dea590b39)

import jackharrhyCom from "@images/babble-bin/i-like-astro/jackharrhy-com.png"

## [www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/)

around july of 2022, i also switched over my [mun page](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/tree/c2a82aa90b11725d4169dc02aed780192bd94747) to astro, the site that i currently have this blog post hosted on!

<br />

## [jackharrhy.neocities.org](https://jackharrhy.neocities.org/)

then, after all the others, in december of 2022, i moved [my neocities page over to astro](https://github.com/jackharrhy/jackharrhy.neocities.org/tree/09d6514ebd63cf2a57a23ed2b41f80c39a210011)
