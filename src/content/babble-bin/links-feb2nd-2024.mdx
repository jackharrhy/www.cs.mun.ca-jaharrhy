i consume many feeds, and sometimes i see posts i like, and
wish to comment on

i also consume other peoples link blogs, so here goes a link
blog esq post of my own!

<br />

1. [stephango.com/flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki)

> Flexoki is an inky color scheme for prose and code.

i've always liked the look and feel of stephs' blog (and
content of course), planning to see how this fits my
personal site and potentially refactor its colors for the
first time in a while to use this

<br />

2. [codedamn.com/news/product/dont-use-prisma](https://codedamn.com/news/product/dont-use-prisma)

> We migrated to SQL. Our biggest learning? Donâ€™t use Prisma

i really liked using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) when i started to build
[stickertrade](https://github.com/fogo-sh/stickertrade), and
since i deploy to a boring single host docker container setup, the
issue of the underlying execution engine being a few megabyte bundle never bit me, but
i can see this being annoying within a serverless
environment since it would affect the [cold start](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/operatorguide/execution-environments.html#cold-start-latency)
latency quite a bit

also the point _'There is no concept of SQL-level joins in
Prisma.'_, i wasn't aware of this, and if this is true, what
an interesting lack of a seemingly to me at least important feature

i'm planning on migrating stickertrade to [Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
next time i return to the project, and honestly i think if
the writer of this article gave Drizzle a look as well
they'd likely follow suit, seems like Drizzle is what Prisma
_should_ have been, _properly TypeScript-native from the start_,
no schema DSL, no large execution engine blob, much more ergonomic hand-written
queries, etc.

3.  [github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov)

> General Coordinates Network (GCN) web site

if there was ever a pristine example of real world [Remix](https://remix.run/) app
(in my opinion), this seems to be it

how [breadcrumbs are handled](https://github.com/nasa-gcn/gcn.nasa.gov/blob/9b8c2ab33ad0c9f98084ca8c803750f7ba8ce2ad/app/root/Title.tsx)
is quite clever, first time seeing [useMatches](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/hooks/use-matches)
in the wild

> The cat is out of the bag: we are working on Rolldown, a rust port of Rollup. ðŸ¦€

Evan You, creator of [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), announcing Rolldown, which
aims to replace esbuild and Rollup within Vite into one solution

this is a big deal in my opinion, since esbuild is currently what
makes Vite fast to build during development (since it mostly
_doesn't_ build in dev.), and Rollup is used for
production builds; there has always been a distinct
separation between dev mode and prod output mode

i always assumed this is just how Vite has to work, since
both esbuild and Rollup seem like big enough projects they
would be outside the scope of being rewritten within/for Vite itself, but
with Rolldown being announced and planned as something which
can do both the esbuild approach of
at-request-time-non-bundling-bundling, and also an optimized
production-build-at-the-same-time, is really neat to me

i'm happy Vite exists, i no longer have to fight with
unruly Webpack configuration files for both my one off
personal projects and work repositories, and get something
as simple yet extendable without the need to 'eject'

still keeping an eye out on [Turbopack](https://turbo.build/pack),
but i feel like Turopack is still hyper-focused on being the
best tooling for [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), we will have to see if that remains
the case forever though

5.  [deno.news/archive/deno-october-update-deno-137-and-deno-queues](https://deno.news/archive/deno-october-update-deno-137-and-deno-queues)

> Deno October Update: Deno 1.37 and Deno Queues

_"Modern JavaScript in Jupyter notebooks"_ seems nice, i wonder
if you can use MDX with this and have an almost
storybook-like experience, i guess not though since it would
have no browser APIs

still neat

<br />

6.  [blog.stackblitz.com/posts/announcing-wasi](https://blog.stackblitz.com/posts/announcing-wasi/)

> Announcing Native Language Support in WebContainers

the title of this blog post is '...native language support...',
but i am more hyped by the slug, _`announcing-wasi`_, i
like whenever i see a StackBlitz link to a code example,
and have been happy to see them move towards doing more and
more in the browser without relying on cloud compute to host
code editing / site viewing things, and i'm also been
awaiting the eventual adoption of [WASI](https://wasi.dev/)
by more and more things

curious to know what aspects of WASI this makes use of,
following through a link in the article led me to [WebAssembly:
An Updated Roadmap for Developers](https://bytecodealliance.org/articles/webassembly-the-updated-roadmap-for-developers),
which mentions `wasi:sockets`

the last time i tried get my hands dirty with WASI the lack
of a socket interface made a lot of interesting two-way
communication out of the question, all you could do was call
a synchronous function and return without any two way
communication, or at least not without adding a lot of glue
code between the WASM runtime and the application code,
ruining the reason one would even reach for WASI in the
first place

i assume a lot of this is either solved problems, or soon to
be solved problems now

nice

> An Interactive Intro to CRDTs

not really much to say here, i like this article :)

the CRDTs / realtime space is one i've wanted to break into
with some little personal projects, but i've never found
time / need for it

i wanted some time ago to muck around with [Delta](https://slab.com/blog/announcing-delta-for-elixir/),
but never looked into that either

someday :)

(also there is a [follow up article](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/)
on building collaborative pixel art editors with CRDTs, now
i really want to dig into this)

8.  [stylex-docusaurus.vercel.app](https://stylex-docusaurus.vercel.app/)

> The Power of Inline Styles. The Speed of Atomic CSS.

a Meta (Facebook) CSS library

i don't get it

i'm too Tailwind-pilled at this point to
understand anything that isn't tailwind adjacent
syntactically

it's ok though, i'm sure if it takes off in two years time i
would have never thought i could have been so silly

> Classic rock, Mario Kart, and why we can't agree on
> Tailwind

i wasn't planning on including this link here, but it
surfaced in my [miniflux](https://miniflux.app/) feed
through being posted on [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs/), and it
felt like the logical next link to include after giving a
vague dis against stylex, i am in the camp of Tailwind
_[smart steering](https://mariokart.fandom.com/wiki/Smart_Steering)_
enjoyer, so i am likely not the target audience of stylex

yeah
