this is the babble bin

i want to do more writing about technical things, and to have a proper blog
with _proper_ blog posts i'm proud to share around and live on my main site

but i have been thinking about this for **too long** without actually exercising
my writing skills / having anything to show for myself really

so, instead of refining my main site to have posts on it, i am starting this
'babble bin', a much more unstructured location for pretty much anything i'd
like to end up

this could be me doing up a linkblog, mentioning cool videos i've watched,
or projects i have worked, or opinions on 'current state of frontend
framework hype cycle'

i will (fingers crossed) have little barrier to entry for the creation of new
content here, since i assume that nobody will read this (but i will still
expose an RSS feed for the folks that maybe might will care), and i can have
this spot just be brain dump central for me

see i don't even like meta-blog content but i am opening this meta-blog with
a meta-meta-blog content but don't care due to the nature of this meta-meta-blog

my intent as well is to have a system i can author new 'posts' for this blog
within my current note taking tool of choice, logseq, very easily, with a
one-stop-shop script to run which cooks up the content within logseq, pushes
it here, and builds everything _automagically_

basically anything to make the barrier to entry for more babble bin content
lower

yeah

this is the babble bin
