for [an ongoing gamejam](https://www.cs.mun.ca/~jaharrhy/gamedev/jams/conjam-apr2024/), we're building games
with the vague relation to game of life / powder game / cellular automata

i've seen the [Comfy](https://comfyengine.org/) engine before, and until now never had a reason to use it,
but for this jam performance matters, and the rendering aspect of things isn't very involved

i still don't have an idea at this point for what to make, so i made game of life!

this is a breakdown of how you can do the same

(side note, just after starting this project, the creator of the engine
[posted this amazing blog post](https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/), if you're actually planning on
using rust for large gamedev projects, read this first, and then pick another language / engine lol)
