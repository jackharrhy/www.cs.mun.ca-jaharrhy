🥱, hello everyone, its advent of code time

similar to [[what i did last year]](../../2022/), i am going to
be doing these here _rambles_, in which i talk about both my
solution for a certain days problem, and also give a look around
at the way other people solve it as well

---

**\- excuse time -**

you might notice that this is being posted on the 11th, which is
ten days after the day that it is covering

you are indeed true, and i am quite late this year, but alas, i am
here and ready to go

i initially had big ideas and plans for this year, but things got
out of hand before the month of december even started

i had a chance to give a talk at [[DevFest St.John's 2023]](https://gdg.community.dev/events/details/google-gdg-st-johns-presents-devfest-st-johns-2023/) (again,
same time last year-ish, also mentioned in last years rambles),
and low and behold i procrastinated even worse this year, working on
my slides until 30 minutes before i was supposed to give my talk

thankfully, it was still a great talk, [[which you can view the slides / recording fo here]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/beyond-the-browser/),
but doing this def. took a lot of the wanting-to-do-stuff-outside-of-work
mental energy away from me, and i also caught a nasty old headcold that
drained every bit of physical energy out of me, so the combo meant i did
much more [[gaming]](https://www.backloggd.com/u/jackharrhy/) the last bit
rather than advent-of-code-ing (also doesn't help my steamdeck oled came in
at the same time as well...)

**\- end excuse time -**

---

so, my last few years of advent of code have followed a pattern:

- 2019, crystal
- 2020, crystal
- 2021, elixir
- 2022, elixir

i have always done two years a row in the same language, before moving
onto another

my intent this year was to use another language, and after breily
consdering ocaml, i ended up initially picking rust, since:

- i like rust
- rust is fast, previous years elixir has held me back (it seems)
  on problems that can be brute forced with a more performant
  programming language (this is likely just a _skill issue_ on my
  own part)
- it means that i will have changed up the language once more,
  continuing the trend

so when day 1 came, picked up rust, [[this did not last that long]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/advent2023/commit/4918a37e2ba6f6b6157e4c1245ae2fdff5226063)

<details>
<summary>click to view my _attempt_ at writing a solution in rust</summary>

<br />

i looked at the problem, thought that pulling out a [[regular expression]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
was the play to do this but _easy_, had a working piece of code written
in rust using everything standard library (only nonstandard thing was [[cargo aoc]](https://github.com/gobanos/cargo-aoc), used for a nice cli wrapper / input data fetcher)

but it didn't work

this felt quite frustrating to run into on the first part of the first day,
until i saw a post on reddit outlining a special case that my code failed on

```
eighthree
```

here, i would use a regex, consume the `eight` into a match group, and then
basically disregard the three, which is important since if you parse
from the left instead of the right, this would indeed resolve to a
three rather than a eight

so, a little bit of googling made me realize that what i wanted here
were [[lookahead assertions]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression#Assertions)
to ensure i could basically parse a group, and then still use pieces
of that group in future matches

sadly, no dice for this being something built into the crate i reached
for initiall, [[regex]](https://docs.rs/regex/latest/regex/), and while
did find [[fancy_regex]](https://docs.rs/fancy-regex/latest/fancy_regex/)
(built by the same guy who made [[ripgrep]](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)),
i couldn't figure out how to get the library to do what i wanted

what i am describing, i know, is a skill issue, but for the things
that my brain is reaching for to solve problems to be giving me this
much issue out of the gate, makes me think i am not going to perist
very far into advent of code like this

i love rust, i want to write more rust, but i think it is better suited
(at least for me) for programs that _matter_ more, like cross platform clis,
or high performance web apis, and other pieces of software that live longer
and will be used by more / be at the core of something, not really the
type of language to write one of solutions to problems in which once you have
the input, you are done

for those of you writing rust, power to you, you have less of a skill
issue with rust than i do, but i myself and going back to my cozy
dynamic programming land for advent of code

and so, i decided to end my streak of new lang every two years,
and i am going back to the interesting choice in 2021, the cozy choice in
2022, and now the fallback super cozy choice of 2023

i don't really have any other reason to write elixir at the moment,
therefore here is one, and here i go again!

tl;dr, i am back on the [[elixir]](https://elixir-lang.org/) train once again

<details>
<summary>click to view my _actual_ solution, in elixir</summary>

<br />

given the sample input:

```
two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
input =
  input
  |> Kino.Input.read()
  |> String.split("\n")
  |> Enum.map(fn line ->
    line
    |> String.codepoints()
    |> Enum.map(fn codepoint ->
      case Integer.parse(codepoint) do
        {x, _} -> x
        :error -> codepoint
      end
    end)
  end)
```

read in this input, split on each newline, which
will return a list of strings, each string being a single line

then, map over each of these lines, break them into individual [[codepoints]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_point),
and map each codepoint which a function that attempts to parse the codepoint
into an integer, and if fails, will just return the codepoint as-is

```elixir
[
  ["t", "w", "o", 1, "n", "i", "n", "e"],
  ["e", "i", "g", "h", "t", "w", "o", "t", "h", "r", "e", "e"],
  ["a", "b", "c", "o", "n", "e", 2, "t", "h", "r", "e", "e", "x", "y", "z"],
  ["x", "t", "w", "o", "n", "e", 3, "f", "o", "u", "r"],
  [4, "n", "i", "n", "e", "e", "i", "g", "h", "t", "s", "e", "v", "e", "n", 2],
  ["z", "o", "n", "e", "i", "g", "h", "t", 2, 3, 4],
  [7, "p", "q", "r", "s", "t", "s", "i", "x", "t", "e", "e", "n"]
]
```

We then end up with this nice list of lists,
the contents of the lists are either single strings/codepoints, or single digit numbers

### part 1

my approach of part 1 / 2, is inspired from when i peaked at [[EthanDenny's day 1 solution]](https://github.com/EthanDenny/advent-of-code-2023/blob/main/src/day1.rs)
while i was still tackling this in rust

```elixir
input
|> Enum.map(fn line ->
  first = Enum.find(line, &is_number(&1))
  last = Enum.find(Enum.reverse(line), &is_number(&1))

  if is_nil(first) do
    0
  else
    first * 10 + last
  end
end)
|> Enum.sum()
```

take our formatted input, and iterate over each line

```elixir
  first = Enum.find(line, &is_number(&1))
```

first, find the first thing in the list that is a number, using
the aptly named and very handy [[`is_number/1`]](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.15.7/Kernel.html#is_number/1)
to check, if it is, a _number_

this gets us the first number in the list

```elixir
  last = Enum.find(Enum.reverse(line), &is_number(&1))
```

and then, for last, just reverse the list around, and do the same thing again,
but since we reversed the list, it will be the last number in the list!

```elixir
  if is_nil(first) do
    0
  else
    first * 10 + last
  end
```

then, once we have both, simply do `first * 10` to ensure the first single digit becomes a two digit number
(i.e. 2 -> 20, 6 -> 60), and then add the second value to get the reconstructed
number for that row

(this if check, is that on using the second example input, some rows do not have any numbers in them, this
makes sure the code does not crash when it does not find a number)

```elixir
|> Enum.sum()
```

then, just sum the rows into one big number, and boom, the answer!

(curious what this funky `|>` operator is? [[learn more here about the pipe operator]](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/pipe_operator))

### part 2

part 2 is going to be conceptually similar to part 1, but since we have to match
on enter lists of words, things must be a bit busier

```elixir
number_words = ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six", "seven", "eight", "nine"]

number_words_reversed =
  number_words |> Enum.map(&String.reverse(&1))

all_words =
  (number_words ++ number_words_reversed)
  |> Enum.map(&String.codepoints(&1))
```

the idea i'm going with for this problem, is starting
off with a list of numbers 1-9, spelt out (as you can see, above that is `number_words`)

and then, reverse each one

then, combine them back together

```elixir
[
  ["o", "n", "e"],
  ["t", "w", "o"],
  ["t", "h", "r", "e", "e"],
  # ...
  ["n", "e", "v", "e", "s"],
  ["t", "h", "g", "i", "e"],
  ["e", "n", "i", "n"]
]
```

this gives us a list of 9 + 9 = 18 lists of strings, that we can use to [[pattern match]](https://joyofelixir.com/6-pattern-matching)
each line of input as we scan through it

the full solution can be found [[here]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/advent2023/blob/main/day1.livemd)

```elixir
defmodule Trebuchet do
  def calibrate([], _words), do: nil

  def calibrate([num | _rest], _words) when is_number(num) do
    num
  end

  def calibrate(line, words) do
    num =
      words
      |> Enum.find(fn word ->
        List.starts_with?(line, word)
      end)

    if is_nil(num) do
      Trebuchet.calibrate(tl(line), words)
    else
      Trebuchet.understand_handwriting(num, words)
    end
  end

  def understand_handwriting(word, words) do
    index = Enum.find_index(words, fn w -> w == word end)
    value = if index >= 9, do: index - 8, else: index + 1
    value
  end
end
```

for this, i break out my first module, since we are reaching for [[tail recursion]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call)
for this problem

before i explain the above `Trebuchet` module, let me first show its usage:

```elixir
input
|> Enum.map(fn line ->
  first = Trebuchet.calibrate(line, all_words)
  last = Trebuchet.calibrate(Enum.reverse(line), all_words)

  first * 10 + last
end)
|> Enum.sum()
```

this is basically the exact same code as before, except the first and last are fetched from calling the `callibrate/2`
function from module

```elixir
  def calibrate([], _words), do: nil

  def calibrate([num | _rest], _words) when is_number(num) do
    num
  end

  def calibrate(line, words) do
    num =
      words
      |> Enum.find(fn word ->
        List.starts_with?(line, word)
      end)

    if is_nil(num) do
      Trebuchet.calibrate(tl(line), words)
    else
      Trebuchet.understand_handwriting(num, words)
    end
  end
```

`calibrate/2` has three definitions

- when the line passed to the function is an empty list, return nil, this will break later bits of the program but i
added it for completeness
- calibrate with a list that the head is a number, just take the number as-is
- the third and final case, the most generic case (where the list is neither empty, nor has a number as the head), will
then be checked to see if the list starts with each word in the word list
  - if it does not, go another layer deep but this time with the tail of the list, i.e. the rest of it
  - if it does, use a little handy function to go from `["o", "n", "e"]` -> `1`

```elixir
  def understand_handwriting(word, words) do
    index = Enum.find_index(words, fn w -> w == word end)
    value = if index >= 9, do: index - 8, else: index + 1
    value
  end
```

said handy function is the above code which finds the index in the big list of words, if its 1-9, just go from index to
number, if not, then do index - 8 since its of of the backwards numbers that start from 1 starting at 9

```elixir
|> Enum.sum()
```

then, again, sum the rows into one big number, and boom, the part 2 answer!

again, thanks to ethan for indirectly helping me come up with the approach to this one
