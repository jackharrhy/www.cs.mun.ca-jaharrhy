given the sample input:

```
47|53
97|13
97|61
97|47
75|29
61|13
75|53
29|13
97|29
53|29
61|53
97|53
61|29
47|13
75|47
97|75
47|61
75|61
47|29
75|13
53|13

75,47,61,53,29
97,61,53,29,13
75,29,13
75,97,47,61,53
61,13,29
97,13,75,29,47
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
[rules, updates] = input |> String.split("\n\n")
```

split the input into the rules as one string, and the updates as another

```elixir
rules = rules
  |> String.split("\n")
  |> Enum.map(fn rule ->
    rule
    |> String.split("|")
    |> Enum.map(&(String.to_integer(&1)))
  end)
```

basic newline split, map, split on `|`, then map to integer

```elixir
[
  [47, 53],
  [97, 13],
  [97, 61],
  [97, 47],
  ..
]
```

we get the rules

```elixir
updates = updates
  |> String.split("\n")
  |> Enum.map(fn update ->
    update
    |> String.split(",")
    |> Enum.map(&(String.to_integer(&1)))
  end)
```

same as above, but we split on `,`

```elixir
[
  [75, 47, 61, 53, 29],
  [97, 61, 53, 29, 13],
  [75, 29, 13],
  [75, 97, 47, 61, 53],
  [61, 13, 29],
  [97, 13, 75, 29, 47]
]
```

we get the updates

```elixir
rule_lookup = rules
  |> Enum.group_by(fn [a, _b] -> a end)
  |> Enum.map(fn {k, v} ->
    {k, v |> Enum.map(fn [_a, b] -> b end) |> MapSet.new()}
  end)
  |> Map.new()
```

lastly, i create a map to use a lookup table, from value,
to what values should come before it

```elixir
%{
  29 => MapSet.new([13]),
  47 => MapSet.new([13, 29, 53, 61]),
  53 => MapSet.new([13, 29]),
  61 => MapSet.new([13, 29, 53]),
  75 => MapSet.new([13, 29, 47, 53, 61]),
  97 => MapSet.new([13, 29, 47, 53, 61, 75])
}
```

so rules from the input, like these:

```
47|53
47|13
47|61
47|29
```

become:

```elixir
47 => MapSet.new([13, 29, 53, 61]),
```

nice little lookup table

<br />

```elixir
check_valid = fn update ->
  for {num, index} <- Enum.with_index(update) do
    {before_updates, _after_updates} = update |> Enum.split(index)
    for before_update <- before_updates do
      Enum.member?(Map.get(rule_lookup, before_update, []), num)
    end
  end
  |> List.flatten()
  |> Enum.all?()
end
```

lastly, here's a little function that checks to see if a given update is valid

i iterate through each number in the list, with its index:
```elixir
for {num, index} <- Enum.with_index(update) do
```

i then split the list to get every number _before_ the number we're on:
```elixir
{before_updates, _after_updates} = update |> Enum.split(index)
```

then, go through each item before, and ensure that the number we have is a member
of the rule lookup:
```elixir
for before_update <- before_updates do
    Enum.member?(Map.get(rule_lookup, before_update, []), num)
end
```

then, flatten this list, and expect all of the values to be true

if any value isn't true, we've broken a rule

<br />

### part 1

```elixir
for update <- updates do
  is_valid = check_valid.(update)
  
  if is_valid do
    Enum.at(update, floor(length(update) / 2))
  else
    nil
  end
end
|> Enum.filter(&(&1))
|> Enum.sum()
```

with the handy valid function, we go through each update, and if its
valid, we calculate the midpoint, fetch it, and sum all midpoints

<br />

### part 2

```elixir
for update <- updates do
  is_valid = check_valid.(update)

  if is_valid do
    nil
  else
    update
    |> Enum.sort(fn a, b ->
      Enum.member?(Map.get(rule_lookup, a, []), b)
    end)
    |> Enum.at(floor(length(update) / 2))
  end
end
|> Enum.filter(&(&1))
|> Enum.sum()
```

part 2 took me a bit longer than expected, and i didn't first know the trick to it

thankfully riley gave me a tip that a _sort_ function might be all you need, which
did pass my mind as i was considering this problem, but i thought wouldn't be enough

low and behold, you can indeed just `Enum.sort`

so yeah, we use `check_valid` again, but this time, we find things that are _not_ valid,
use `Enum.sort` with a lookup into the `rule_lookup` like before, get the midpoint, throw in
a filter on the identity function to filter out `nil`, then sum

amazin
