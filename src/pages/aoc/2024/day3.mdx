pretty nice day 3 question, and especially nice to those who can wield the finite state automata, otherwise
known to most programmers as _regular expressions_

i'm curious to see regular expression usage in different languages today here, but also potentially
some solutions that will be regular expressionless

lets dive into it

<summary>click to view my solution</summary>

<br />

given the sample input:

```
xmul(2,4)%&mul[3,7]!@^do_not_mul(5,5)+mul(32,64]then(mul(11,8)mul(8,5))
```

assuming `instructions` is the above as one big string,

### part 1

```elixir
validate = fn instructions ->
  Regex.scan(~r/mul\((?<a>\d*),(?<b>\d*)\)/, instructions)
  |> Enum.map(fn [_match, a, b] ->
    String.to_integer(a) * String.to_integer(b)
  end)
  |> Enum.sum()
end

validate.(instructions)
```

regular expression time, techncially i'm using named capture groups here, but the `Regex.scan` function i'm
using from elixir doesn't really make use of them, but does still give me the capture groups seperate to the entire matched string

```elixir
~r/mul\((?<a>\d*),(?<b>\d*)\)/
```

to break down the regex though, i expect to match on some section of the string that starts with `mul`,
then an opening parentheses (needed to escape it with `\`)

then, here is where i use actual parentheses to section out any number of digits, followed by a comma, and then any number of digits, ensuring that
it ends with an actual closing parentheses at the end

<br />

the output of `Regex.scan` on my input, yields:

```elixir
[
    ["mul(2,4)", "2", "4"],
    ["mul(5,5)", "5", "5"],
    ["mul(11,8)", "11", "8"],
    ["mul(8,5)", "8", "5"]
]
```

so, mapping over that with:

```elixir
|> Enum.map(fn [_match, a, b] ->
    String.to_integer(a) * String.to_integer(b)
end)
```

will give:

```elixir
[8, 25, 88, 40]
```

which we simply `Enum.sum` on, to get `161`, the answer for part 1!

<br />

### part 2

```elixir
String.split("do()#{instructions}", "don't()")
|> Enum.map(fn instructions ->
  [_ignore | rest] = String.split(instructions, "do()")
  rest |> Enum.join()
end)
|> Enum.join()
|> then(fn instructions ->
  validate.(instructions)
end)
```

so, part 2 throws in some interesting clauses about some `do()` and `don't()`s turning off the multiplying,

and i thought to myself, maybe can i just string split on the `don't()`, and then string split on the `do()`,
and then anything that is to the _left_ of the `do()`, is valid

so that is exactly what this code does, i throw in a `do()` at the start of the instruction string, as
the question states this is the case, so my string splitting works, and then just reconstruct a string
that is only the sections that should be turned on, and run that through the validate function from part 1

curious to see if anyone else came up with this solution, or if i'm ✨ special ✨

my mum calls my special so i must be

i started this on day 8, after just finishing day 2s ramble, and now onto starting day 4!
