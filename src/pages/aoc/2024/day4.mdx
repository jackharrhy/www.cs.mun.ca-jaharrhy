import Other from "@components/aoc/Other2024.astro";
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';

it comes every year, and yet, who is ever fully prepared...

(im sure some are but i always have to remember again how to do grid shenanigans)

_its grid time baby_

<br />

many different ways to approach representing a grid, and also what operations are available on grids
if people have busy standard libaries / reach for numpy (curious to see arafat this time around...)

time to do some word searchin'

<summary>click to view my solution</summary>

<br />

given the sample input:

```
MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
rows = String.split(input, "\n")

row_count = length(rows)
col_count = Enum.at(rows, 0) |> String.length()

input = input
  |> String.replace("\n", "")
  |> String.graphemes()
  |> Enum.map(&(String.to_atom(&1)))
```

breakup the rows, get the length, then get the column length

im pretty sure the input is always a prefect `n` x `n` grid, but oh well

then, replace the newlines in the input with empty string, map over the graphemes,
which will give us each thing as a single string thats a single character, then map over the characters and
turn them into elixir symbols

```elixir
[:M, :M, :M, :S, :X, :X, :M, :A, :S, :M, :M, ..
```

we get a _flat_ list of symbols to work with

my intent is to do integer div / mod operators to go from grid position to index, and index to grid position

<br />

### part 1

```elixir
x_locations = input
|> Enum.with_index()
|> Enum.filter(fn {char, _index} -> char == :X end)
```

first, we find each x position, and use `Enum.with_index` to get its index in the list

```elixir
defmodule WordSearchV1 do
  @next %{
    :X => :M,
    :M => :A,
    :A => :S
  }

  def navigate({input, row_count, col_count} = board, {x, y}, vec, expecting) do ..
  def find_xmases({_input, row_count, col_count} = board, start_index) do ..
end
```

the code for this is a bit chunkier than before, for part 1 i pull out this
module `WordSearchV1`, that has a mapping from character to the expected next character,

`find_xmases/1` is the entrypoint, and `navigate/1` is the recursive function
that will keep navigating through the grid (i call it board in the code) until it either

- gets through an entire `[:X, :M, :A, :S]` section of values
- gets through partially but then sees a value it does not expect
- gets out of bounds

```elixir
def find_xmases({_input, row_count, col_count} = board, start_index) do
  i_x = rem(start_index, col_count)
  i_y = div(start_index, row_count)

  for x <- -1..1 do
    for y <- -1..1 do
      if x == 0 && y == 0 do
        false
      else
        vec = {x, y}
        pos = {i_x + x, i_y + y}
        navigate(board, pos, vec, :M)
      end
    end
  end
  |> List.flatten()
  |> Enum.filter(&(&1))
end
```

`find_xmases/1` takes in the input `:X` point, and does some `Range` magic
to get a vector for each position around the center point, and starts
running navigate from that position, with that movement vector, and expects the next
value it sees to be `:M`, the value after the `:X` we know we already have

we expect navigate to return a boolean depending on if it was a valid xmas or not,
and we flatten the return value from the navigate calls, and filter out any non `true` values
before returning it to the caller

```elixir
def navigate({input, row_count, col_count} = board, {x, y}, vec, expecting) do
  if (x < 0 or x > row_count) or (y < 0 or y > col_count) do
    false
  else
    index = row_count * y + x
    val = Enum.at(input, index)

    if val == expecting do
      if val == :S do
        true
      else
        {x_mod, y_mod} = vec
        pos = {x + x_mod, y + y_mod}
        navigate(board, pos, vec, Map.fetch!(@next, expecting))
      end
    else
      false
    end
  end
end
```

then, in navigate:

- we do the out of bounds check, false if thats hit
- then, we do the math to go from `{x, y}` vector to index in flat list, get the value, and
  expect that value to be the next value in the map
  - if that is the case, we go to the next position via a recursive call to navigate, using the `@next` map to get the next value that iteration should check for
  - if not, we return false

```elixir
for {_x, x_location} <- x_locations do
  WordSearchV1.find_xmases({input, row_count, col_count}, x_location)
end
|> List.flatten()
|> Enum.count()
```

making use of `WordSearchV1`, we call it for each `x_location`, and get back all of the lists of `true`,
we flatten that list of lists of true, and count how many `true`s we have

and we get the answer!

<br />

### part 2

```elixir
a_locations = input
|> Enum.with_index()
|> Enum.filter(fn {char, _index} -> char == :A end)
```

same as `x_locations`, but this time, `a`

```elixir
defmodule WordSearchV2 do
  def get_value_from_pos({input, row_count, col_count}, x, y) do ..
  
  def find_x_mases({_input, row_count, col_count} = board, center) do ..
end
```

no need to pull our recursion this time, but we need a new `WordSearch`, so we make new `WordSearchV2` here

```elixir
def find_x_mases({_input, row_count, col_count} = board, center) do
  c_x = rem(center, col_count)
  c_y = div(center, row_count)

  if c_x - 1 < 0 or c_x + 1 > col_count or c_y - 1 < 0 or c_y + 1 > row_count do
    false
  else
    top_left = get_value_from_pos(board, c_x - 1, c_y - 1)
    top_right = get_value_from_pos(board, c_x + 1, c_y - 1)
    bottom_left = get_value_from_pos(board, c_x - 1, c_y + 1)
    bottom_right = get_value_from_pos(board, c_x + 1, c_y + 1)

    left_pair = case {top_left, bottom_right} do
      {:M, :S} -> true
      {:S, :M} -> true
      _ -> false
    end

    right_pair = case {top_right, bottom_left} do
      {:M, :S} -> true
      {:S, :M} -> true
      _ -> false
    end

    is_valid = left_pair and right_pair
    
    is_valid
  end
end
```

look at each value around the `:A`, and check to see if either the top left / bottom right, or bottom left / top right are the right tuple either forwards or backwards
and then if both pairs are valid, we have a valid x-mas!

```elixir
def get_value_from_pos({input, row_count, col_count}, x, y) do
  if x < 0 or x >= col_count or y < 0 or y >= row_count do
    nil
  else
    index = row_count * y + x
    Enum.at(input, index)
  end
end
```

just a util function to go from `{x, y}` vector to value, and if its out of bounds, just return `nil`

for some questions wraparound is needed, and this method makes wraparound _easy_, but here i have to actively
fight against wrap around with all of these bounds checks... oh well

```elixir
for {_x, a_location} <- a_locations do
  WordSearchV2.find_x_mases({input, row_count, col_count}, a_location)
end
|> List.flatten()
|> Enum.filter(&(&1))
|> Enum.count()
```

same as before, flatten them lists of booleans, then only get `true` ones, then count 'em

nice
