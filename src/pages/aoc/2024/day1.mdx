import Other from "@components/aoc/Other2024.astro";

its december, so that means, **advent of code time**, **_lets go_**

<br />

im hyped to give another go at rambles this year, i started working on rambles in 2023,
but didn't actually make it to publishing my work-in-progress day 1 post, oh well

_for context of those that didn't see my 2022 rambles_, this is a spot where i discuss
advent of code solutions, starting with my own (that i attempt to break down step by step),
then digging into solutions by others, giving commentary on them, sometimes throwing in some
suggestions

<br />

as expected, day 1 is cozy, and the breakdown of how to come to the final answer in the example,
provided in the question, _sort of_ explains the steps to write the program in the language of your choice

<br />

---

im returning to my beloved, [[elixir]](https://elixir-lang.org/), this year, and it seems
like i'm not the only this time around!

both in mine, and probably other functional language solutions, **you'll likely see the pipe operator, `|>`**,
if you want a little elixir-focused primer on said operation, check out elixir schools [[Pipe Operator]](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/basics/pipe_operator) lesson

not much activity on the [[proposal to add this operator to js]](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-pipeline-operator), but a man can wish...

<br />

given the sample input:

```
3   4
4   3
2   5
1   3
3   9
3   3
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string, lets do some input parsing:

```elixir
{left_list, right_list} =
  input
  |> String.split("\n")
  |> Enum.map(fn line ->
    [l, r] = line
      |> String.split("  ")
      |> Enum.map(&(String.to_integer(String.trim(&1))))
    {l,r}
  end)
  |> Enum.unzip()
```

first, split string on newline character, returns a list of lines

map over each line, and then, split on that line by two spaces to break up `3 4` to `["3", "4"]`

then, map over the trimmed value of each of those strings (trimmed since i think for some reason i had spaces left in my input? skill issue),
and convert them from string into integer

in this map statement, i return a tuple of the left value, and the right value

this means, before the final `Enum.unzip`, the data structure looks like:

```elixir
[{3, 4}, {4, 3}, {2, 5}, {1, 3}, {3, 9}, {3, 3}]
```

since i want a list of all of the left values, and all of the right values, the structure i've created is what `Enum.zip` returns,

so, `Enum.unzip`, gives me:

```elixir
{[3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 3], [4, 3, 5, 3, 9, 3]}
```

_nice_

### part 1

```elixir
Enum.zip(Enum.sort(left_list), Enum.sort(right_list))
  |> Enum.map(fn {l, r} ->
    abs(l - r)
  end)
  |> Enum.sum()
```

its day 1, therefore part 1 fits into a small footprint, no need to even break it up
into multiple explanatory chunks

since the question is asking to compare smallest numbers in both right and left lists, ascending,
sorting both lists, then re-`Enum.zip`-ing them, gives us the numbers that need to be
compared together in tuple pairs

so, map over tuple pairs, and take the absolute value of the `l - r`, to get the distances

then, sum the result via `Enum.sum`, _boom_, we get the `11` total distance the example asks for, and i get a star!

### part 2

```elixir
right_counts = right_list
  |> Enum.group_by(&(&1))
  |> Enum.map(fn {k, v} ->
    {k, Enum.count(v)}
  end)
  |> Map.new()

for n <- left_list do
  n * Map.get(right_counts, n, 0)
end
|> Enum.sum()
```

part 2 is also nice and compact

<br />

first, lets discuss the creation of `right_counts`

```elixir
right_counts = right_list
  |> Enum.group_by(&(&1))
  |> Enum.map(fn {k, v} ->
    {k, Enum.count(v)}
  end)
  |> Map.new()
```

here, i take the right list, and use `Enum.group_by` (passing in an identity anonymous function), which gives me:

```elixir
%{3 => [3, 3, 3], 4 => [4], 5 => [5], 9 => [9]}
```

i map over that to return the values of this map as the count rather than a list of each value, which gives me:

```elixir
[{3, 3}, {4, 1}, {5, 1}, {9, 1}]
```

i then pipe that to `Map.new()`, since iterating over the `Map` returned by `Enum.group_by` gets mucked up by the map, giving me the map:

```elixir
%{3 => 3, 4 => 1, 5 => 1, 9 => 1}
```

so a lookup from value `->` how many times in the right list it exists

<br />

paired with this list, the last section is quite easy to grok:

```elixir
for n <- left_list do
  n * Map.get(right_counts, n, 0)
end
|> Enum.sum()
```

iterate over the left list, use the value in the right list (or 0 if no value) to multiply with the value in the left list we're on

then, do a little bit of `Enum.sum`

we get the example answer, and after running my test input, i get a second star!

### others

time to peep others solutions!

i've dug through people who i checked out in 2022, and seen
people post links to their advent of code solutions in the [[MUN Computer Science Society]](https://muncompsci.ca/) discord, and the [[CTSNL]](https://ctsnl.ca/) discord,
so i've compiled a list of people to _peep_ for solutions and give some _rambles_ here

if you've ended up being included and would rather _not_ be, reach out to my via the message box at the bottom of the page, sorry!

likely not much to say today here since its day 1 and all, but likely the _most_ to say from a
sheer volume perspective since day 1 means _many_ solutions!

<br />

overall, a nice day 1, good set of people to go over solutions for this it feels as well! a _lot_ more go than expected, and
glad to have some people alongside me for elixir :)

lets see how long i can keep these rambles up for, i'm currently finishing up this post at `1:14 AM` on day 4, so i have a backlog of two more days to get to, and _then_ to do todays,
but hopefully i get into a roll here (and people fall off so i have less to review :D)

eventually the problems become meaty to the point i need more time to focus on them than i have to write about, so that will liiikely be the end

but at least for the next few days, _lets do this_

<br />
