welcome to day 2! _(as i'm writing this the night of day 4, hopefully getting this out before the day 5 problem is posted)_

> _and as i'm finishing this up on day 8... sorry about that LOL_

no need for preamble explaining what this is, day 1 explains that, time to jump into it

<br />

given the sample input:

```
7 6 4 2 1
1 2 7 8 9
9 7 6 2 1
1 3 2 4 5
8 6 4 4 1
1 3 6 7 9
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
reports =
  input
  |> String.split("\n")
  |> Enum.map(fn line ->
    line
    |> String.split(" ")
    |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer(&1))
  end)
```

basic input parsing here today, split into lines, take each line, split on empty string, map each thing returned to integer, so we get:

```elixir
[
  [7, 6, 4, 2, 1],
  [1, 2, 7, 8, 9],
  [9, 7, 6, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 2, 4, 5],
  [8, 6, 4, 4, 1],
  [1, 3, 6, 7, 9]
]
```

<br />

### part 1

```elixir
defmodule RedNoseReports do
  def process([a | [b | t]]) do
    if a - b > 0 do
      process([a | [b | t]], :up)
    else
      process([a | [b | t]], :down)
    end
  end
  
  def process([a | [b | t]], direction) do
    correct_direction = case direction do
      :up -> a - b > 0
      :down -> a - b < 0
    end
  
    diff = abs(b - a)
    if (diff > 3 or diff == 0) or not correct_direction do
      false
    else
      process([b | t], direction)
    end
  end

  def process(report, _direction) when is_list(report) and length(report) == 1 do
    true
  end
end
```

i wanted to reach for recursion in this problem, alongside [[multiple clause functions]](https://exercism.org/tracks/elixir/concepts/multiple-clause-functions),
so pulling out a module made sense

i usually _don't_ have to pull them out this early, but oh well

lets break this down

<br />

you'll notice if i remove the function bodies, this module actually just defines the same function a bunch of different times

```elixir
defmodule RedNoseReports do
  def process([a | [b | t]]) do ...
  
  def process([a | [b | t]], direction) do ...

  def process(report, _direction) when is_list(report) and length(report) == 1 do ...
end
```

the first case, is the intended _entry_ case (while i don't have the other two functions defined as `defp`, which would make them private, they could be
since they are basically internal impl. details)

the second case, is similar to the first, but includes a _direction_ the list is heading in (i.e. is it ascending or descending)

and last but not least, then the `report` variable is an empty list, assume we've made it all the way through the list and made it through each value,
so whatever list we just parsed must be correct

the only other thing to note before making note of their internals, is the `[a | [b | t]]` syntax

<br />

in elixir, `[x | y] = list`, will set `x` equal to the _head_ of the list, and `y` will be the tail, i.e. a reference to the next node in the list,
which itself contains a value and a tail

elixirs _list_ is not an _array_, it is a proper linked list

elixir has a way of working with arrays, through the fact that [[array]](https://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/stdlib/array.html) exists in erlang,
but since linked lists are more _functional_, elixir is very focused around them, and has this dedicated syntax

so, with this knowledge, look again at this:

```elixir
[a | [b | t]] = list
```

here, we would get the head of list, and put it into `a`, but also get the next node, and gets its value, and put it in `b`, then have `t` be the rest of the list

and because elixir is _dope_, we can do this _in the function definition_, so we don't even have to destructure in the function body

thanks elixir

<br />

back to actually talking about my solution

take a single 'report' from the input:

```elixir
[7, 6, 4, 2, 1]
```

the intent is to send that into the module like so:

```elixir
RedNoseReports.process(report)
```

since i'm only passing in one argument, that will call `process/1` (in elixir/erlang, you can refer to a smaller subset of what functions
will match a certain clause by putting their [[arity]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arity) after a `/`, for example, if you have the function foo that takes in 3 arguments, its `foo/3`)

in my module, i only have one definition of `process/`, and here it is:

```elixir
def process([a | [b | t]]) do
  if a - b > 0 do
    process([a | [b | t]], :up)
  else
    process([a | [b | t]], :down)
  end
end
```

i use the trick in the function definition to extract out the two first items in the linked list, check to see if the difference between
the numbers is positive (we're going up) or negative (we're going down),

and then, i call `process/2`, with an [[atom]](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/basic-types.html#atoms), to indicate which direction i expect
_all_ values to head in

as mentioned earlier, there are _two_ definitions of `process/2`,

```elixir
def process([a | [b | t]], direction) do ...

def process(report, _direction) when is_list(report) and length(report) == 1 do ...
```

the first is the [[recursive step]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#Formal_definitions), and the second is the [[base case]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion#Formal_definitions)

the recursive step is defineed as so:

```elixir
def process([a | [b | t]], direction) do
  correct_direction = case direction do
    :up -> a - b > 0
    :down -> a - b < 0
  end

  diff = abs(b - a)
  if (diff > 3 or diff == 0) or not correct_direction do
    false
  else
    process([b | t], direction)
  end
end
```

i use `case`, which is sort of a pattern match powered _super powerful_ switch case statement, in which here i am using maybe 5% of its power
to check if the direction is `:up` or `:down`

i then get the non negative difference between the values, ensure we're heading in the right direction from the earlier calculation, and if
any of these checks fails, we short circuit (and i guess have a sort of failure case base case), and return `false`

if we do pass everything, we process the next section of the list, we don't just pass in `t`, we pass in `[b | t]`, since we want the next
iteration to process `b` as if it was `a`, with its _own_ `b`

then, for our _super busy final base case_:

```elixir
def process(report, _direction) when is_list(report) and length(report) == 1 do
  true
end
```

we return true!

we do some guard checks here to make sure the list has been used up (we assume we're left with just a single value, since it means it
passed the previous `a` / `b` test, and there is nothing left to validate)

<br />

we let the caller deal with the `true` and `false` values, so all thats left to discuss, is this:

```elixir
for report <- reports do
  RedNoseReports.process(report)
end
|> Enum.count(&(&1))
```

iterate over the input reports, the big list of signal data, pass each one to our entry process function, and then take the count of each
value returned from that with is truthy, and we can the answer of 2!

<br />

### part 2

ill be honest, i tried to apply a more bespoke custom recursive version of this for part 2, i actually had a version that worked against
the sample input, but failed against my real input...

i parked working on this for a bit, and was curious how others were approaching this

this message from riley gave me direction of to do a _little_ bit of extra work, to get the answer using my existing code!

> In case it helps, my approach was just loop over each index in the report, remove it, and use the validation code from part a on it. If any of those instances are valid, the report if valid for part 2

and so, i did exactly that:

```elixir
for report <- reports do
  if RedNoseReports.process(report) do
    true
  else
    for index_to_remove <- 0..length(reports) do
      modified_report = 
        report
        |> Enum.with_index()
        |> Enum.reject(fn {_value, index} -> index == index_to_remove end)
        |> Enum.map(fn {value, _index} -> value end)

      RedNoseReports.process(modified_report)
    end
    |> Enum.any?
  end
end
|> Enum.count(&(&1))
```

this is basically the same code as before, the `if` check basically says if its already valid, then we're good with it

but _now_, if its _not_ valid, iterate through each one of the possible versions of the reports, check to see if each one of them is valid,
and if _any_ of them are valid, then we return true

this is obviously super slow, i _could_ be checking the lists as i go along rather than computing _each_ version of the list and creating a huge
list of `true` / `false` values

but

guess what

i wrote the code, _got the star_, and **_moved on_**

### others

i added some code to the stuff i use [[behind the scenes]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/blob/80444b8e6a665ad838d60fb9fb2c31e9fc44b072/src/data/aoc/2024/data.ts)
to make these rambles easier, to _randomize_ the list i review submissions in

ill be honest, if you're near the _end_ of my review session, i will likely have less to say since i've likely already said it about someone elses
solution first

_but_, hopefully less of that if every time i export the day template, i get a fresh ordering of others

therefore, your placement is now beholden to `/dev/urandom` or something

_lets get to it_

i managed to finish this on the evening of day 8, since i myself was quite busy, well:

- starting a new job at [[Spellbook]](https://www.spellbook.legal/)
- un-jet-lagging myself from a trip to the uk the two weeks prior to advent of code
- getting stuck on day 4 part 2, and then needing to play catch-up this weekend to have all of the
  the stars, and sadly, i must get my stars before i can review other people getting their stars

godspeed self, on doing more of these, if i can do more than 2022 i'd be appy :)
