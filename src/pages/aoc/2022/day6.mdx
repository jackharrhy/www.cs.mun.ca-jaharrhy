import Other from "@components/aoc/Other.astro";

a **calm** (before the storm)

much easier parsing today, no need to even bother reading seperate lines!

clean solutions galore as well

lets get on with it

<br />

given the sample input:

```
mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
packets = input |> String.graphemes()
```

split input into its characters

i say _characters_, but the [[underlying function]](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.14/String.html#graphemes/1) is named graphemes,
since it is splitting on _unicode graphemes_

```elixir
["m", "j", "q", "j", "p", "q", "m", "g", "b", "l", "j", "s", "p", "h", "d", "z", "t", "n", "v", "j",
 "f", "q", "w", "r", "c", "g", "s", "m", "l", "b"]
```

we are left with list of... i'm gonna call them charcaters again its easier to write

```elixir
defmodule CommunicationDevice do
  def find_first_duplicate(packets, chunk_size) do
    index =
      packets
      |> Enum.chunk_every(chunk_size, 1, :discard)
      |> Enum.map(&MapSet.new(&1))
      |> Enum.with_index()
      |> Enum.find(fn {set, _index} -> MapSet.size(set) == chunk_size end)
      |> elem(1)

    index + chunk_size
  end
end
```

nice little single function module here!

`find_first_duplicate/2` accepts our list of packets, and a _chunk_size_ parameter

```elixir
# ...
packets
|> Enum.chunk_every(chunk_size, 1, :discard)
# ...
```

this solution relies on [[Enum.chunk_every/4]](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/1.14/Enum.html#chunk_every/4)
quite a bit, it basically acts as a _sliding window_

<br />

say i was given the list `[1,2,3,4]`, and used this chunk_every function
with the firt argument the list, the second the chunk size (2), and the
third being the step, (with the :discard atom), we would get the following enumerable:

```elixir
[[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]
```

(the :discard atom is used to ensure we don't get a `[4]` show up in
this list, if any returned enumerable is less than the size of the chunk,
it is discarded)

<br />

back to the function,

```elixir
# ...
|> Enum.map(&MapSet.new(&1))
|> Enum.with_index()
# ...
```

then, we map over each one of these chunks into `MapSet`s

and we include the index (what step we are on) by mapping
the resulting `MapSet`s enumerable with `Enum.with_index`

```elixir
[
  {MapSet.new(["j", "m", "q"]), 0},
  {MapSet.new(["j", "p", "q"]), 1},
  {MapSet.new(["j", "p", "q"]), 2},
  {MapSet.new(["j", "m", "p", "q"]), 3},
  {MapSet.new(["g", "m", "p", "q"]), 4},
  # ...
]
```

we are left with this, the first three `MapSet`s with a length less
than 4 characters, even though 4 characters (we are using part 1 as the example
here) were used to generate them, _but_ the 4th item in this list having
a `MapSet` with a size of 4, implies no duplicates in the characters used to
produce this one!

```elixir
# ...
|> Enum.find(fn {set, _index} -> MapSet.size(set) == chunk_size end)
|> elem(1)
# ...
```

pluck out the first tuple with a `MapSet` the size of our chunk size, and pluck
the second item out of the tuple, since we are concerned with the index and not
the actual `MapSet` itself

```elixir
# ...

index + chunk_size
```

then, with this index, return it _plus_ the `chunk_size`, since the value on
the end of the window would be the first non-duplicate we run into in the
devices stream, and if we just returned the index, it would be incorrectly
offset

### part 1

```elixir
CommunicationDevice.find_first_duplicate(packets, 4) # -> 7
```

with our new fangled device module, use it, with a chunk size of 4

### part 2

```elixir
CommunicationDevice.find_first_duplicate(packets, 14) # -> 19
```

and, do it again, but with a chunk size of 14

nice

there's going to be _lots of inline code_ today
