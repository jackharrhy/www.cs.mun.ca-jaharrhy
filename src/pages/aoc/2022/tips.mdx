during my ramblings, i comment on the solutions of others

sometimes i pick at things, rather it be something that i see
as more busy than it needs to be, or a solution that looks like
its not making use of a language feature / library / syntax
that it could to be _cleaner_

instead of pointing out solutions to everything, this _tips_
page will be used as a point of reference of how to do things
_a bit cleaner_, and but most importantly **_in my opinion_**,
therefore **please take what i say with a grain of salt**, but
if you do respect and apply my recommendations, _nice_

## general

### functional programming

_use the functions, luke!_

this is the one to take **_the most grains of salt_** with

<br />

i am solving my problems with [[Elixir]](https://elixir-lang.org/) this year,
which is a functional programming language, so my headspace while solving
the problems myself is _very functional_, therefore suprisingly when i
look at other peoples code, i will probably notice when it is / isn't
functional

a great example of this was commenting on [[andrew reynolds]](https://github.com/apreynolds1989/AdventOfCode2022/)
day 3 solution, that it was _so close_ to being functional, and recommended refactoring his `forEach`
a `reduce`, since it was being used to create a sum

now andrew did go and do this _the next day_, which is flattering,
but mentioned that it ate up the 'majority' of his time refactoring
a `forEach` into a `reduce`

its not my goal here to affect peoples problem solving strategies in such a way
that things get harder, only to point out my comment / opinions on things

(while its not my goal, if it happens, and the person enjoys my methodology, i
won't complain .-. )

<br />

i've gotten ahead of myself and not even defined functional programming, oops

from [[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming):

> _In computer science, functional programming is
> a programming paradigm where programs are constructed by **applying and
> composing functions**. It is a declarative programming paradigm in which
> function definitions are trees of expressions that map values to other values,
> rather than a sequence of imperative statements which update the running
> state of the program._

## language-specific

### python

#### list comprehension

with list comprehension

```py
squares = []

for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)
```

this

```py
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]
```

can become this

list comprehension is a neat tool to be aware of, and use to
iterate over things without the use of a full-size for loop, in one
small line

the [[official python docs]](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions)
cover them well

_but **please don't go crazy with these**_

i usually find reading _other peoples_ list comprehension statements
confusing, and that might just be a personal preference thing, but
i think there is potentially a sacrifice of readability over space

if your goal is to [[code golf]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf) and get
your solution as _small_ as possible, 100% abuse these to the max

<br />

to pluck some [[day 3 code from mudkip]](https://github.com/Mudkip/AdventOfCode/blob/main/2022/day03/3.py#L3)

```py
rucksacks = ((set(list(x[:len(x)//2])), set(list(x[len(x)//2:]))) for x in input)
```

there is too much going on here!

now, for mudkip, the goal _is_ to have lots going on in one line, i.e. code golfing

but if i see this sort of thing in code at my workplace, i screech

<br />

but, from [[brianna's solution to day4]](https://github.com/briannamcdonald/advent-of-code-2022/blob/main/day04/day4_part1.py#LL8C9-L8C55)

```py
r1x, r1y = [int(x) for x in range1.split("-")]
```

this is a _nice_, but more importantly in my opinion, _simple_ usage of list comprehension

this is still doing a lot! its splitting some string on `"-"`, mapping each value
returned from this to an interger, and unpacking the returned list into two values

### typescript

#### deno

_the land of the dinosaurs_

might not be following a good tutorial / the correct path, but i find quickly bootstrappping
a sensible typescript node project _frustrating_, usually i reach for `ts-node`, but i always
run into several different issues, and have to play wack-a-mole with them to make it behave /
not give me errors / actually run the code

if this is the case, you might want to **give [[Deno]](https://deno.land/) a go** instead

even if its not to have a better typescript expierence,
[[check out the deno standard library]](https://deno.land/std@0.167.0),
which is packed with useful modules, such as [[collections]](https://deno.land/std@0.167.0/collections/mod.ts)

> _Functions for specific common tasks around collection types like Array and Record. This module is heavily inspired by kotlins stdlib._

with functions / classes such as

1. `intersect`: _Returns all distinct elements that appear at least once in each of the given arrays._

2. `BinarySearchTree`: _An unbalanced binary search tree. The values are in ascending order by default, using JavaScript's built-in comparison operators to sort the values._

and look how easy / simple it is to do basic things like [[read a file]](https://deno.land/api@v1.28.3?s=Deno.open)
without a bunch of fluff
