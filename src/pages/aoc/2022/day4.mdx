import Other from "@components/aoc/Other2022.astro";

managed to snag this one faster than yesterdays, although i found due to having pulled out set
operations yesterday, my brain went right back to them again, even though clearly there were
tricks here to avoid doing that

oh well, currently optimizing for _speed of solution_, therefore the first method that pops into
my head is what i run with :)

given the sample input:

```
2-4,6-8
2-3,4-5
5-7,7-9
2-8,3-7
6-6,4-6
2-6,4-8
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
sets =
  input
  |> String.split("\n", trim: true)
  |> Enum.map(fn line ->
    line
    |> String.split(",")
    |> Enum.map(fn pair ->
      pair
      |> String.split("-")
      |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer/1)
      |> Enum.reduce(&Range.new(&1, &2))
      |> MapSet.new()
    end)
  end)
```

a busier input parse today!

i usually consider 'input parsing' to include converting
the input into some data structure / set of data structures
that are the preamble to the actually problems solving meat

here we take each line, split it by `,`, and then iterate
over each pair

then we split the inner pair into two values, map them to integers,
and use reduce to go from `[1,4]` to the _range_ `0..4`

with this range, we can then use `MapSet.new`, which will decompose the range
into a set of its values

```elixir
[
  [MapSet.new([2, 3, 4]), MapSet.new([6, 7, 8])],
  [MapSet.new([2, 3]), MapSet.new([4, 5])],
  [MapSet.new([5, 6, 7]), MapSet.new([7, 8, 9])],
  [MapSet.new([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]), MapSet.new([3, 4, 5, 6, 7])],
  [MapSet.new([6]), MapSet.new([4, 5, 6])],
  [MapSet.new([2, 3, 4, 5, 6]), MapSet.new([4, 5, 6, 7, 8])]
]
```

here is what we end up with after input parsing

_yet again_, a _list of lists appears infront of us_

and, for the second day in a row, i have reached for `MapSet`s

### part 1

```elixir
sets
|> Enum.filter(fn [a, b] -> MapSet.subset?(a, b) || MapSet.subset?(b, a) end)
|> Enum.count() # -> 2
```

then, we filter out every pair in which one `MapSet` is a subset of the other `MapSet`, and count it

### part 2

```elixir
sets
|> Enum.filter(fn [a, b] -> MapSet.intersection(a, b) |> Enum.count() != 0 end)
|> Enum.count() # -> 4
```

similarly, for the second part, we filter out every pair in the intersection of the `MapSet`s results in nothing, i.e. no intersection, and count it

my code for today is clean, but as you can see by quite a few of the solutions bellow, this is quite inefficient :P

the full solution can be found [[here]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/advent2022/blob/main/day4.livemd)

### others

less people here than in previous days, but that might
also just be folk taking a break on the weekend

while i write this, its 2:25pm, so some might not gotten
around to completing it yet either, i will try my best
to go back and review peoples repos to add them, _but
i am simply human_

### meta

building this summary of each day has been fun, but i started it on friday night,
and it has consumed quite a bit of my weekend, but i really do want to keep it up!

there is a [[secret page]](../jack-utils/) that i've put together to help myself:

1. **get the links to everyones repos** / places they are putting their solutions,
   so i can hunt down if people have completed days or not easier

2. **automagically generate, based on the day, links to each persons solutions**
   some people have a file-per-solution

   so i link directly to those, and some have folders that usually contain part 1 & two, so i link to the folders

   some people are too tricky to link to, so i either have a custom handling solution for them, or
   fall back to just linking to the repository itself

3. after making quick inventory of who has completed a day, **generate the boilerplate markdown**
   for the 'others' section

i still want to write out each block, so that bit isn't being automated away, i just want
during the work week to speed this up :)

all of this is being done [[within this repository]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy)
if you are curious to peep the inner workings

in a future _meta_ section i will cover more about the static site generator being used here,
how i recreated the advent of code _look and feel_, and other meta goodies
