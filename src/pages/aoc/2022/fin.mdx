so

i didn't end up making it to multi-digit days ramble wise,
and only made it to day 15 part 1 star-wise myself, but hey

i had a blast for when i did this, and intended on putting
in the most work when a large amount of people were doing it,
since as expected, there was considerable fall off from 9 - 15

star wise, i intended on beating last year, and i ended up tying
with myself instead, i'll gladly take that!

although aoc isn't over, its been over for myself for quite a bit,
and also over for everyone previously mentioned in the others section
so i am doing this 'fin' post on christmas eve

happy holidays to all, you'll likely see a return of this next
year!

\- jack, the rambler
