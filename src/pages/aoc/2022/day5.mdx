a _spicy_ day!

not a hard problem to understand, but a wonky thing to parse into something useful
before actually solving the problem

seems like some people skipped bothering to parse the input as-is and just manually
typed up the stacks into their programs

this probably would be the way to go for speed, but as mudkip said today:

> [12:01 PM] mudkip: I treat input as sacred and immutable

i too, treat input as sacred and immutable, but power to you if you did otherwise

<br />

given the sample input:

```
    [D]
[N] [C]
[Z] [M] [P]
 1   2   3

move 1 from 2 to 1
move 3 from 1 to 3
move 2 from 2 to 1
move 1 from 1 to 2
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
[initial_state_string, instructions_string] =
  input
  |> Kino.Input.read()
  |> String.split("\n\n", trim: true)
```

pull out the `\n\n` split trick, but this time to break the two
parts of the problem into their own chunks

```elixir
[
  "    [D]    \n[N] [C]    \n[Z] [M] [P]\n 1   2   3 ",
  "move 1 from 2 to 1\nmove 3 from 1 to 3\nmove 2 from 2 to 1\nmove 1 from 1 to 2"
]
```

its time for some _fun_ parsing

### parsing initial state

```elixir
rows =
  initial_state_string
  |> String.split("\n")
  |> Enum.reverse()
  |> tl()
  |> Enum.reverse()
```

so first, i will focus on parsing the initial state into
something useful

split on newline, the usual, and a quick reverse -> `tl` -> reverse
to pluck the stack labels away

```elixir
[
  "    [D]    ",
  "[N] [C]    ",
  "[Z] [M] [P]"
]
```

we are left with this, which is still quite _raw_, but we can work with this

```elixir
rows =
  rows
  |> Enum.map(fn line ->
    line
    |> String.graphemes()
    |> tl
    |> Enum.take_every(4)
  end)
```

so, we're only concerned with every 4 characters, the `] [` that seperate them
are not important to us, so we do just that!

firstly, using `String.graphemes` on the line splits it from a string to a list
of its characters

since the `Enum.take_every` function will always take the first element
of the given enumerable, we take the tail of the linked list (using `tl`)
and then take every 4th value from the list of characters

```elixir
[
  [" ", "D", " "],
  ["N", "C", " "],
  ["Z", "M", "P"]
]
```

we are left with this, a lot nicer than the input, _but_ its the wrong way,
visually here the columns are aligned, but the underlying rows are not!

```elixir
initial_state =
  rows
  |> Enum.reduce(List.duplicate([], length(rows) + 1), fn row, acc ->
    Enum.zip(row, acc)
    |> Enum.map(fn {row, acc} -> [row | acc] end)
    |> Enum.map(&Enum.filter(&1, fn item -> item != " " end))
  end)
  |> Enum.map(&Enum.reverse(&1))
```

doing a bit of reduce magic, start with a list of empty lists of length of the
amount of rows we have

then, reduce each row into the lists of lists by inserting each nth item of the
row into the nth list of lists, and filter out any values that are simply space characters

```elixir
[
  ["N", "Z"],
  ["D", "C", "M"],
  ["P"]
]
```

this is better, visually this isn't as nice as the above, but now each
column is in its own seperate list, which will make operating on it later
a lot nicer

### parsing instructions

```elixir
instructions =
  instructions_string
  |> String.split("\n")
  |> Enum.map(fn instruction ->
    instruction
    |> String.split(" ")
    |> tl
    |> Enum.take_every(2)
    |> Enum.map(&String.to_integer(&1))
  end)
```

parsing the instructions is much nicer than the initial state :)

similar usage of `Enum.take_every` happens here, except acting on a list
of words instead of characters

```elixir
[
  [1, 2, 1],
  [3, 1, 3],
  [2, 2, 1],
  [1, 1, 2]
]
```

here, the 0th item is the amount to move, the second is the from location, and the third is the two location

### utils

```elixir
defmodule CargoCrane do
  def activate(model, instructions, initial_state) do
    Enum.reduce(instructions, initial_state, fn [move, from, to], state ->
      to_move =
        state
        |> Enum.at(from - 1)
        |> Enum.take(move)

      state
      |> List.update_at(to - 1, fn stack ->
        case model do
          :CrateMover9000 -> (to_move |> Enum.reverse()) ++ stack
          :CrateMover9001 -> to_move ++ stack
          _ -> raise "I don't know that model of crane!"
        end
      end)
      |> List.update_at(from - 1, fn stack ->
        stack |> Enum.drop(move)
      end)
    end)
  end

  def inspect_tops(state) do
    state |> Enum.map(&hd(&1)) |> Enum.join()
  end
end
```

the _meat_

#### activate/3

```elixir
def activate(model, instructions, initial_state) do
```

here, we accept 3 arguments, `model`, `instructions`, and `initial_state`

model should either `:CrateMover9000` or `:CrateMover9001`, depending on the mode
of operation expected by the user

instructions is simply our list of instructions

and initial_state is our list of stacks that we will apply the instructions
to

```elixir
Enum.reduce(instructions, initial_state, fn [move, from, to], state ->
```

the first thing we do is start a `Enum.reduce`, and pass in the
instructions as the thing we shall be reducing over, but the initial
accumulator will be our initial state

the idea here, is that the accumulator should always be something
that represents a list of stacks, and each time we reduce over the
list of instructions, what we return from this inner function is
the _next_ state after applying a given instruction

also happening on this line is destucturing the list into three
variables, `move`, `from`, and `to`

```elixir
to_move =
  state
  |> Enum.at(from - 1)
  |> Enum.take(move)
```

within this inner function, take the items we need from the stack
we are moving from, and store them in a `to_move` variable

this does not mutate anything, because in this language thats
not on the table

```elixir
state
|> List.update_at(to - 1, fn stack ->
  case model do
    :CrateMover9000 -> (to_move |> Enum.reverse()) ++ stack
    :CrateMover9001 -> to_move ++ stack
    _ -> raise "I don't know that model of crane!"
  end
end)
|> List.update_at(from - 1, fn stack ->
  stack |> Enum.drop(move)
end)
```

the next block is busy, but not bad

as mentioned previously mutations are no bueno, so `List.update_at`
can be used to _update_ an item within a list at a given index, and return
a new list with the changes made

the first `List.update_at` is to put the items we just stored in `to_move`
into the target location

here, we use a case statement on model to match if we are the 9000 or
9001 model, and either append the reversed version of the list to the target
stack, or the list as-is

or just raise with "I don't know that model of crane!" if that case fails

and for the second `List.update_at`, we drop the amount we moved from the
stack we moved from

#### inspect_tops/1

```elixir
def inspect_tops(state) do
  state |> Enum.map(&hd(&1)) |> Enum.join()
end
```

given a state, pluck the heads from each of the stacks, and join them
together into a string

this is used to spit out the answer that can be fed directly into the
advent of code text field

### part 1

```elixir
CargoCrane.activate(:CrateMover9000, instructions, initial_state)
|> CargoCrane.inspect_tops() # -> "CMZ"
```

so there was a lot of preamble before, but as you can see, our
part 1 is a two liner

### part 2

```elixir
CargoCrane.activate(:CrateMover9001, instructions, initial_state)
|> CargoCrane.inspect_tops() # -> "MCD"
```

and our part 2 is a similar two liner with a different crate mover model!

wow

i stayed up early, again, but this one was the longest to figure out solutions so far

```
5   00:47:43  9363      0   00:50:06  8313      0
```

from my [[personal stats]](https://adventofcode.com/2022/leaderboard/self) page,
you can see it took me 47 minutes, from problem release, to solve, to answer this question

_but_, then only about two minutes after that to solve part 2, so a tiny delta between
solutions :D

i had work in the morning, and two alarms that should have woken me up for it, but alas
due to flying too close to the sun, i slept through the alarms and awoke at 11am

no more 1:30am problem solving for me :), now to see if i can flip around to waking up
super early to complete problems instead...

<br />

due to i think sloppy wording on my part, we have **a guest star** today
helping out with the rambling!

<br />

for context, earlier in conversation with [[sven]](https://github.com/STollenaar/AdventOfCode2022/), he mentioned

> [1:44 PM] Secure Cluster Nerd 5000: Just waiting for the rambling now 🙂

to which i replied

> [2:30 PM] ja (gmup): ramblings will be later during the work week sadly

what i meant here was that ramblings would be later during _the day_, during the work week,
not that i would do them later in the work week

marty then jumped in and said

> [4:10 PM] mort: i'll do jacks writeup for him today and put up a PR
>
> [4:10 PM] mort: xD

i didn't immediately correct him and assumed the `xD` implied it was a joke

it was not a joke, [[he did end up putting up a pr]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy/pull/4)

so this post is a combination of his preabmle / comments, and also my own ramblings

_ramble 2x_

(everything marty wrote is from the perspective of me not being here)

here is the marty preamble:

---

<DitherMert /> hey guys, [[mert]](https://github.com/lilmert) here. I'm filling
in for jack today cause he slept in and told his fans he needed an earned break.
Until then you're stuck with my shitty, less productive reviews... onwards!

my general comments for today - _the spice level is increasing_. We rarely see this in AoC but
today was an instance of our input data having its form defined prior to, what would be more
commonly referred to as, the action data.

there's a couple ways I see you could handle this. The first would be a brute force copy paste
into a manual refactoring and storage of the data you want. When it comes to speed, this might
be considered quicker with less brain overhead, as the second you choose to parse the input and
make sense of it, you've more of less added a 3rd programming part to the problem.

<br />

### meta

as covered in [[yesterdays  meta]](../day4/#meta), my little jack utils page has helped
speed up the creation of this document, but today was a bit different anyways with the
accidental guest apperance, if this happens again (which i hope it does!), hopefully
it'll be arranged instead :)

i created a page yesterday and didn't talk about it, but i might as well mention
it now, there is a [[tips]](../tips/) page, which i am using to collect different
recommendations / jackisms / etc. in one place
