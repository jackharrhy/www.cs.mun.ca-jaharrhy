hey guys, [mert](https://github.com/lilmert) here. I'm filling in for jack today cause he slept in and told his fans he needed
an earned break. Until then you're stuck with my shitty, less productive reviews... onwards!

as of 4:56PM Dec. 5th NDT, we have... counting all of jack's friends... 

my general comments for today - _the spice level is increasing_. We rarely see this in AoC but
today was an instance of our input data having its form defined prior to, what would be more 
commonly referred to as, the action data. 

there's a couple ways I see you could handle this. The first would be a brute force copy paste
into a manual refactoring and storage of the data you want. When it comes to speed, this might
be considered quicker with less brain overhead, as the second you choose to parse the input and
make sense of it, you've more of less added a 3rd programming part to the problem.

### others

less people here than in previous days, but that might
also just be folk taking a break on the weekend

while i write this, its 2:25pm, so some might not gotten
around to completing it yet either, i will try my best
to go back and review peoples repos to add them, _but
i am simply human_

### meta

building this summary of each day has been fun, but i started it on friday night,
and it has consumed quite a bit of my weekend, but i really do want to keep it up!

there is a [[secret page]](../jack-utils/) that i've put together to help myself:

1. **get the links to everyones repos** / places they are putting their solutions,
   so i can hunt down if people have completed days or not easier

2. **automagically generate, based on the day, links to each persons solutions**
   some people have a file-per-solution

   so i link directly to those, and some have folders that usually contain part 1 & two, so i link to the folders

   some people are too tricky to link to, so i either have a custom handling solution for them, or
   fall back to just linking to the repository itself

3. after making quick inventory of who has completed a day, **generate the boilerplate markdown**
   for the 'others' section

i still want to write out each block, so that bit isn't being automated away, i just want
during the work week to speed this up :)

all of this is being done [[within this repository]](https://github.com/jackharrhy/www.cs.mun.ca-jaharrhy)
if you are curious to peep the inner workings

in a future _meta_ section i will cover more about the static site generator being used here,
how i recreated the advent of code _look and feel_, and other meta goodies
