3rd night in a row up until 1:30am .-.

why do i make these choices

oh well this one was nice, got to pull out more functional programming goodies today,
and found reviewing others submissions a little more engaging than previous days, hopefully that continues!

given the sample input:

```
vJrwpWtwJgWrhcsFMMfFFhFp
jqHRNqRjqzjGDLGLrsFMfFZSrLrFZsSL
PmmdzqPrVvPwwTWBwg
wMqvLMZHhHMvwLHjbvcjnnSBnvTQFn
ttgJtRGJQctTZtZT
CrZsJsPPZsGzwwsLwLmpwMDw
```

assuming `input` is the above as one big string,

```elixir
rucksacks =
  input
  |> String.split("\n", trim: true)
  |> Enum.map(&String.split(&1, "", trim: true))
```

a pretty simple input parse today, just split on newlines, and then split each string into a list of characters

```
[
  ["v", "J", "r", "w", "p", "W", "t", "w", "J", "g", "W", "r", "h", "c", "s", "F", "M", "M", "f",
   "F", "F", "h", "F", "p"],
  ["j", "q", "H", "R", "N", "q", "R", "j", "q", "z", "j", "G", "D", "L", "G", "L", "r", "s", "F",
   "M", "f", "F", "Z", "S", "r", "L", "r", "F", "Z", "s", "S", "L"],
  ["P", "m", "m", "d", "z", "q", "P", "r", "V", "v", "P", "w", "w", "T", "W", "B", "w", "g"],
  ["w", "M", "q", "v", "L", "M", "Z", "H", "h", "H", "M", "v", "w", "L", "H", "j", "b", "v", "c",
   "j", "n", "n", "S", "B", "n", "v", "T", "Q", "F", "n"],
  ["t", "t", "g", "J", "t", "R", "G", "J", "Q", "c", "t", "T", "Z", "t", "Z", "T"],
  ["C", "r", "Z", "s", "J", "s", "P", "P", "Z", "s", "G", "z", "w", "w", "s", "L", "w", "L", "m",
   "p", "w", "M", "D", "w"]
]
```

another day, another list of lists

```elixir
defmodule Rucksack do
  def item_to_priority(item) do
    item |> String.to_charlist() |> Enum.at(0) |> item_number_to_priority
  end

  def item_number_to_priority(number) when number >= 97, do: number - 96
  def item_number_to_priority(number), do: number - 38
end
```

once we find the duplicate item in the rucksack(s), we'll need to map that to some priority number

here, i go from string -> charlist -> single char, and then use some sneaky guard clauses to do
math on the single char value which maps it from its value in ascii, to the priority number

### part 1

```elixir
rucksacks
|> Enum.map(fn rucksack ->
  rucksack
  |> Enum.split(round(length(rucksack) / 2))
  |> Tuple.to_list()
  |> Enum.map(&MapSet.new(&1))
  |> Enum.reduce(&MapSet.intersection(&1, &2))
  |> Enum.at(0)
  |> Rugsack.item_to_priority()
end)
|> Enum.sum() # -> 157
```

i do a lot here

first, i want to map over each rucksack, since for part one we are concerned about splitting
up a rucksack into two chunks, and finding a duplicate between each chunk

i use `Enum.split` to split the rucksack into two chunks, which gives me a tuple, so i use
`Tuple.to_list()` to turn it back into a list i can iterate over

i then, convert each list into a `MapSet`, since i want to perform a [[set operation]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mathematics)#Basic_operations) to find the duplicate

i then reduce my list of two items down to _one_, using a reducer that passes its values to `MapSet.intersection`, which will end up only reducing once, since the first item will be the accumulator, and the second item will be the only other value the reducer handles

after this operation i am left with a single `MapSet`, with only a single value within it, the duplicate

i use `Enum.at(0)` to pluck out the single item from the `MapSet`, passing it to my utility function to convert from item -> priority number

i do this for every rucksack, and compute the sum of the list of priorities

### part 2

```elixir
rucksacks
|> Enum.chunk_every(3)
|> Enum.map(fn rucksacks ->
  rucksacks
  |> Enum.map(&MapSet.new(&1))
  |> Enum.reduce(&MapSet.intersection(&1, &2))
  |> Enum.at(0)
  |> Rugsack.item_to_priority()
end)
|> Enum.sum() # -> 70
```

this is _similar_ to the above, however, i use `Enum.chunk_every(3)` to convert
my list of rucksacks into a list of lists of rucksacks, each nested list having
a length of 3

i iterate over this list of lists, and convert each rucksack in the list of 3
to a `MapSet`, like before, but since i'm not splitting it into two, i use
`Enum.reduce` with `MapSet.intersection` again, but this time i'm reducing 3 `MapSet`s to a single `MapSet`

then, i do the same as before, pluck out the answer, get the priority, and sum everything, ezdubz
